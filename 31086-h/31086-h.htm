<br />
Dear Mr. Gibbons:<br />
</p>

<p>At this time, when you are returning
to America, I wish to express to you my
appreciation of the cordial cooperation
and assistance you have always given us
in your important work as correspondent
of the Chicago Tribune in France. I
also wish to congratulate you on the honor
which the French government has done you
in giving you the Croix de Guerre, which
is but a just reward for the consistent
devotion to your duty and personal bravery
that you have exhibited.</p>

<p>My personal regrets that you are
leaving us at this time are lessened by
the knowledge of the great opportunity
you will have of giving to our people in
America a true picture of the work of the
American soldier in France and of impressing
on them the necessity of carrying on
this work to the end, which can be accomplished
only by victory for the Allied
arms. You have a great opportunity, and
I am confident that you will grasp it,
as you have grasped your past opportunities,
with success. You have always
played the game squarely and with
courage, and I wish to thank you.</p>

<p class='quotsig'>
Sincerely yours,<br />
<br />
John J. Pershing.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>Marshal Foch, the commander of eleven million bayonets,
has written that no man is more qualified than Gibbons
to tell the true story of the Western Front. General
Pershing, Commander-in-Chief of the American Expeditionary
Forces, has said that it was Gibbons' great
opportunity to give the people in America a life-like
picture of the work of the American soldier in France.</p>

<p>The key to the book is the man.</p>

<p>Back in the red days on the Rio Grande, word came
from Pancho Villa that any "Gringos" found in Mexico
would be killed on sight. The American people were interested
in the Revolution at the border. Gibbons went
into the Mexican hills alone and called Villa's bluff.
He did more. He fitted out a box car, attached it to the
revolutionary bandits' train and was in the thick of three
of Villa's biggest battles. Gibbons brought out of Mexico
the first authoritative information on the Mexican
situation. The following year the War Department accredited
him to General Pershing's punitive expedition
and he rode with the flying column led by General Pershing
when it crossed the border.</p>

<p>In 1917, the then Imperial German Government announced
to the world that on and after February 1st its
submarines would sink without warning any ship that
ventured to enter a zone it had drawn in the waters of
the North Atlantic.</p>

<p>Gibbons sensed the meaning of this impudent challenge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
He saw ahead the overt act that was bound to
come and be the cause of the United States entering the
war. In these days the cry of "Preparedness" was echoing
the land. England had paid dearly for her lack of
preparedness. The inefficient volunteer system had cost
her priceless blood. The <i>Chicago Tribune</i> sought the
most available newspaper man to send to London and
write the story of England's costly mistakes for the
profit of the American people. Gibbons was picked for
the mission and arrangement was made for him to travel
on the steamer by which the discredited Von Bernstorff
was to return to Germany. The ship's safe conduct
was guaranteed. Gibbons did not like this feature of
the trip. He wanted to ride the seas in a ship without
guarantees. His mind was on the overt act. He wanted
to be on the job when it happened. He cancelled the
passage provided for him on the Von Bernstorff ship
and took passage on the largest liner in port, a ship large
enough to be readily seen through a submarine periscope
and important enough to attract the special attention of
the German Admiralty. He sailed on the <i>Laconia</i>, an
eighteen thousand ton Cunarder.</p>

<p>On the night of February 27, 1917, when the <i>Laconia</i>
was two hundred miles off the coast of Ireland, the Gibbons'
"hunch" was fulfilled. The <i>Laconia</i> was torpedoed
and suck. After a perilous night in a small boat
on the open sea, Gibbons was rescued and brought into
Queenstown. He opened the cables and flashed to America
the most powerful call to arms to the American
people. It shook the country. It was the testimony of an
eye witness and it convinced the Imperial German Government,
beyond all reasonable doubt, of the wilful and
malicious murder of American citizens. The Gibbons
story furnished the proof of the overt act and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
unofficially admitted at Washington that it was the determining
factor in sending America into the war one
month later.</p>

<p>Gibbons greeted Pershing on the latter's landing in
Liverpool. He accompanied the commander of the
American Expeditionary Forces across the Channel and
was at his side when he put foot on French soil. He was
one of the two American correspondents to march with
the first American troops that entered the trenches on
the Western front. He was with the first American
troops to cross the German frontier. He was with the
artillery battalion that fired the first American shell
into Germany.</p>

<p>On June 6th, 1918, Gibbons went "over the top" with
the first waves in the great battle of the Bois de Belleau.
Gibbons was with Major John Berry, who, while leading
the charge, fell wounded. Gibbons saw him fall. Through
the hail of lead from a thousand spitting machine guns,
he rushed to the assistance of the wounded Major. A
German machine gun bullet shot away part of his left
shoulder, but this did not stop Gibbons. Another bullet
smashed through his arm, but still Gibbons kept on. A
third bullet got him. It tore out his left eye and made a
compound fracture of the skull. For three hours he lay
conscious on the open field in the Bois de Belleau with a
murderous machine gun fire playing a few inches over his
head until under cover of darkness he was able to crawl
off the field. For his gallant conduct he received a citation
from General Petain, Commander-in-Chief of the
French Armies, and the French Government awarded him
the Croix de Guerre with the Palm.</p>

<p>On July 5th, he was out of the hospital and back at
the front, covering the first advance of the Americans
with the British forces before Amiens. On July 18th he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
was the only correspondent with the American troops
when they executed the history-making drive against the
German armies in the Château-Thierry salient&mdash;the beginning
of the German end. He rode with the first detachment
of American troops that entered Château-Thierry
upon the heels of the retreating Germans.</p>

<p>Floyd Gibbons was the first to sound the alarm of the
danger of the German peace offensive. Six weeks before
the drive for a negotiated peace was made by the German
Government against the home flank in America, Gibbons
told that it was on the way. He crossed the Atlantic
with his crippled arm in a sling and his head bandaged,
to spend his convalescence warning American audiences
against what he called the "Crooked Kamerad Cry."</p>

<p>Gibbons has lived the war, he has been a part of it.
"And They Thought We Wouldn't Fight" is the voice
of our men in France.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE SINKING OF THE <i>Laconia</i></h3>


<p>Between America and the firing line, there are three
thousand miles of submarine infested water. Every American
soldier, before encountering the dangers of the battle-front,
must first overcome the dangers of the deep.</p>

<p>Geographically, America is almost four thousand miles
from the war zone, but in fact every American soldier
bound for France entered the war zone one hour out of
New York harbour. Germany made an Ally out of the
dark depths of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>That three-thousand-mile passage represented greater
possibilities for the destruction of the United States overseas
forces than any strategical operation that Germany's
able military leaders could direct in the field.</p>

<p>Germany made use of that three thousand miles of
water, just as she developed the use of barbed wire entanglements
along the front. Infantry advancing across
No Man's Land were held helpless before the enemy's
fire by barbed wire entanglements. Germany, with her
submarine policy of ruthlessness, changed the Atlantic
Ocean into another No Man's Land across which every
American soldier had to pass at the mercy of the enemy
before he could arrive at the actual battle-front.</p>

<p>This was the peril of the troop ship. This was the
tremendous advantage which the enemy held over our
armies even before they reached the field. This was the
unprecedented condition which the United States and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Allied navies had to cope with in the great undertaking
of transporting our forces overseas.</p>

<p>Any one who has crossed the ocean, even in the normal
times before shark-like Kultur skulked beneath the water,
has experienced the feeling of human helplessness that
comes in mid-ocean when one considers the comparative
frailty of such man-made devices as even the most
modern turbine liners, with the enormous power of the
wilderness of water over which one sails.</p>

<p>In such times one realises that safety rests, first upon
the kindliness of the elements; secondly, upon the skill
and watchfulness of those directing the voyage, and
thirdly, upon the dependability of such human-made
things as engines, propellers, steel plates, bolts and rivets.</p>

<p>But add to the possibilities of a failure or a misalliance
of any or all of the above functions, the greater
danger of a diabolical human, yet inhuman, interference,
directed against the seafarer with the purpose and intention
of his destruction. This last represents the greatest
odds against those who go to sea during the years of the
great war.</p>

<p>A sinking at sea is a nightmare. I have been through
one. I have been on a ship torpedoed in mid-ocean. I
have stood on the slanting decks of a doomed liner; I
have listened to the lowering of the life-boats, heard the
hiss of escaping steam and the roar of ascending rockets
as they tore lurid rents in the black sky and cast their
red glare o'er the roaring sea.</p>

<p>I have spent a night in an open boat on the tossing
swells. I have been through, in reality, the mad dream
of drifting and darkness and bailing and pulling on the
oars and straining aching eyes toward an empty, meaningless
horizon in search of help. I shall try to tell you
how it feels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>I had been assigned by <i>The Chicago Tribune</i> to go to
London as their correspondent. Almost the same day I
received that assignment, the "Imperial" Government of
Germany had invoked its ruthless submarine policy, had
drawn a blockade zone about the waters of the British
Isles and the coasts of France, and had announced to
the world that its U-boats would sink without warning
any ship, of any kind, under any flag, that tried to sail
the waters that Germany declared prohibitory.</p>

<p>In consideration of my personal safety and, possibly,
of my future usefulness, the <i>Tribune</i> was desirous of
arranging for me a safe passage across the Atlantic.
Such an opportunity presented itself in the ordered return
of the disgraced and discredited German Ambassador
to the United States, Count von Bernstorff.</p>

<p>Under the rules of International courtesy, a ship had
been provided for the use of von Bernstorff and his diplomatic
staff. That ship was to sail under absolute guarantees
of safe conduct from all of the nations at war with
Germany and, of course, it would also have been safe
from attack by German submarines. That ship was the
<i>Frederick VIII</i>. At considerable expense the <i>Tribune</i>
managed to obtain for me a cabin passage on that ship.</p>

<p>I can't say that I was over-impressed with the prospect
of travel in such company. I disliked the thought
that I, an American citizen, with rights as such to sail
the sea, should have to resort to subterfuge and scheming
to enjoy those rights. There arose in me a feeling of
challenge against Germany's order which forbade American
ships to sail the ocean. I cancelled my sailing on
the <i>Frederick VIII</i>.</p>

<p>In New York, I sought passage on the first American
ship sailing for England. I made the rounds of the
steamship offices and learned that the Cunard liner <i>Laconia</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
was the first available boat and was about to sail.
She carried a large cargo of munitions and other materials
of war. I booked passage aboard her. It was
on Saturday, February 17th, 1917, that we steamed away
from the dock at New York and moved slowly down the
East River. We were bound for Liverpool, England.
My cabin accommodations were good. The <i>Laconia</i> was
listed at 18,000 tons and was one of the largest Cunarders
in the Atlantic service. The next morning we were
out of sight of land.</p>

<p>Sailors were stationed along the decks of the ship
and in the look-outs at the mast heads. They maintained
a watch over the surface of the sea in all directions.
On the stern of the ship, there was mounted a
six-inch cannon and a crew of gunners stood by it night
and day.</p>

<p>Submarines had been recently reported in the waters
through which we were sailing, but we saw none of them
and apparently they saw none of us. They had sunk
many ships, but all of the sinkings had been in the day
time. Consequently, there was a feeling of greater
safety at night. The <i>Laconia</i> sailed on a constantly zig-zagging
course. All of our life-boats were swinging out
over the side of the ship, so that if we were hit they
could be lowered in a hurry. Every other day the passengers
and the crew would be called up on the decks
to stand by the life-boats that had been assigned to them.</p>

<p>The officers of the ship instructed us in the life-boat
drill. They showed us how to strap the life-preservers
about our bodies; they showed us how to seat ourselves
in the life-boats; they showed us a small keg of water
and some tin cans of biscuits, a lantern and some flares
that were stored in the boat, and so we sailed along day
after day without meeting any danger. At night, all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the lights were put out and the ship slipped along through
the darkness.</p>

<p>On Sunday, after we had been sailing for eight days,
we entered the zone that had been prohibited by the
Kaiser. We sailed into it full steam ahead and nothing
happened. That day was February the twenty-fifth. In
the afternoon, I was seated in the lounge with two
friends. One was an American whose name was Kirby;
the other was a Canadian and his name was Dugan. The
latter was an aviator in the British army. In fights with
German aeroplanes high over the Western Front he had
been wounded and brought down twice and the army
had sent him to his home in Canada to get well. He
was returning once more to the battle front "to stop another
bullet," as he said.</p>

<p>As we talked, I passed around my cigarette case and
Dugan held a lighted match while the three of us lighted
our cigarettes from it. As Dugan blew out the match
and placed the burnt end in an ash tray, he laughed and
said,</p>

<p>"They say it is bad luck to light three cigarettes with
the same match, but I think it is good luck for me. I
used to do it frequently with my flying partners in France
and four of them have been killed, but I am still alive."</p>

<p>"That makes it all right for you," said Kirby, "but it
makes it look bad for Gibbons and myself. But nothing
is going to happen. I don't believe in superstitions."</p>

<p>That night after dinner Dugan and I took a brisk walk
around the darkened promenade deck of the <i>Laconia</i>.
The night was very dark, a stiff wind was blowing and
the <i>Laconia</i> was rolling slightly in the trough of the
waves. Wet from spray, we returned within and in one
of the corridors met the Captain of the ship. I told him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
that I would like very much to have a look at his chart
and learn our exact location on the ocean.</p>

<p>He looked at me and laughed because that was a very
secret matter. But he replied:</p>

<p>"Oh, you would, would you?" and his voice carried
that particular British intonation that seemed to say,
"Well it is jolly well none of your business."</p>

<p>Then I asked him when he thought we would land in
Liverpool.</p>

<p>"I really don't know," said the ship's commander, and
then, with a wink, he added, "but my steward told me
that we would get in Tuesday evening."</p>

<p>Kirby and I went to the smoke room on the boat deck
well to the stern of the ship. We joined a circle of
Britishers who were seated in front of a coal fire in an
open hearth. Nearly every one in the lighted smoke
room was playing cards, so that the conversation was
practically confined to the mentioning of bids and the orders
of drinks from the stewards.</p>

<p>"What do you think are our chances of being torpedoed?"
was the question I put before the circle in front
of the fireplace.</p>

<p>The deliberative Mr. Henry Chetham, a London solicitor,
was the first to answer.</p>

<p>"Well," he drawled, "I should say about four thousand
to one."</p>

<p>Lucien J. Jerome of the British Diplomatic Service,
returning with an Ecuadorian valet from South America,
advanced his opinion.</p>

<p>I was much impressed with his opinion because the
speaker himself had impressed me deeply. He was the
best monocle juggler I had ever met. In his right eye
he carried a monocle without a rim and without a ribbon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
or thread to save it, should it ever have fallen from his
eye.</p>

<p>Repeatedly during the trip, I had seen Mr. Jerome
standing on the hurrideck of the <i>Laconia</i> facing
the wind but holding the glass disk in his eye with a
muscular grip that must have been vise-like. I had even
followed him around the deck several times in a desire
to be present when the monocle blew out, but the British
diplomatist never for once lost his grip on it. I had
come to the opinion that the piece of glass was fixed to
his eye and that he slept with it. After the fashion of the
British Diplomatic Service, he expressed his opinion most
affirmatively.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," he said with reference to Mr. Chetham's
estimate. "Utter nonsense. Considering the zone that
we are in and the class of the ship, I should put the
chances down at two hundred and fifty to one that we
don't meet a 'sub.'"</p>

<p>At that minute the torpedo hit us.</p>

<p>Have you ever stood on the deck of a ferry boat as it
arrived in the slip? And have you ever experienced the
slight sideward shove when the boat rubs against the piling
and comes to a stop? That was the unmistakable
lurch we felt, but no one expects to run into pilings in
mid-ocean, so every one knew what it was.</p>

<p>At the same time, there came a muffled noise&mdash;not extremely
loud nor yet very sharp&mdash;just a noise like the
slamming of some large oaken door a good distance
away. Realising that we had been torpedoed, my imagination
was rather disappointed at the slightness of the
shock and the meekness of the report. One or two chairs
tipped over, a few glasses crashed from table to floor
and in an instant every man in the room was on his feet.</p>

<p>"We're hit," shouted Mr. Chetham.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's what we've been waiting for," said Mr. Jerome.</p>

<p>"What a lousy torpedo!" said Mr. Kirby. "It must
have been a fizzer."</p>

<p>I looked at my watch; it was 10:30.</p>

<p>Five sharp blasts sounded on the <i>Laconia's</i> whistle.
Since that night, I have often marvelled at the quick coordination
of mind and hand that belonged to the man
on the bridge who pulled that whistle rope. Those five
blasts constituted the signal to abandon the ship. Every
one recognised them.</p>

<p>We walked hurriedly down the corridor leading from
the smoke room in the stern to the lounge which was
amidships. We moved fast but there was no crowding
and no panic. Passing the open door of the gymnasium,
I became aware of the list of the vessel. The floor
of the gymnasium slanted down on the starboard side
and a medicine ball and dozens of dumb bells and Indian
clubs were rolling in that direction.</p>

<p>We entered the lounge&mdash;a large drawing room furnished
with green upholstered chairs and divans and
small tables on which the after-dinner liqueur glasses
still rested. In one corner was a grand piano with the
top elevated. In the centre of the slanting floor of the
saloon was a cabinet Victrola and from its mahogany
bowels there poured the last and dying strains of "Poor
Butterfly."</p>

<p>The women and several men who had been in the
lounge were hurriedly leaving by the forward door as
we entered. We followed them through. The twin
winding stairs leading below decks by the forward hatch
were dark and I brought into play a pocket flashlight
shaped like a fountain pen. I had purchased it before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
sailing in view of such an emergency and I had always
carried it fastened with a clip in an upper vest pocket.</p>

<p>My stateroom was B 19 on the promenade deck, one
deck below the deck on which was located the smoke
room, the lounge and the life-boats. The corridor was
dimly lighted and the floor had a more perceptible slant
as I darted into my stateroom, which was on the starboard
and sinking side of the ship. I hurriedly put on a
light non-sink garment constructed like a vest, which I
had come provided with, and then donned an overcoat.</p>

<p>Responding to the list of the ship, the wardrobe door
swung open and crashed against the wall. My typewriter
slid off the dressing table and a shower of toilet
articles pitched from their places on the washstand. I
grabbed the ship's life-preserver in my left hand and,
with the flashlight in my right hand, started up the hatchway
to the upper deck.</p>

<p>In the darkness of the boat deck hatchway, the rays of
my flashlight revealed the chief steward opening the
door of a switch closet in the panel wall. He pushed on
a number of switches and instantly the decks of the <i>Laconia</i>
became bright. From sudden darkness, the exterior
of the ship burst into a blaze of light and it was
that illumination that saved many lives.</p>

<p>The <i>Laconia's</i> engines and dynamos had not yet been
damaged. The torpedo had hit us well astern on the
starboard side and the bulkheads seemed to be holding
back from the engine room the flood of water that
rushed in through the gaping hole in the ship's side. I
proceeded down the boat deck to my station opposite
boat No. 10. I looked over the side and down upon the
water sixty feet below.</p>

<p>The sudden flashing of the lights on the upper deck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
made the dark seething waters seem blacker and angrier.
They rose and fell in troubled swells.</p>

<p>Steam began to hiss from some of the pipes leading
up from the engine well. It seemed like a dying groan
from the very vitals of the stricken ship. Clouds of
white and black smoke rolled up from the giant grey
funnels that towered above us.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a roaring swish as a rocket soared
upward from the Captain's bridge, leaving a comet's
tail of fire. I watched it as it described a graceful arc
and then with an audible pop it burst in a flare of brilliant
colour. Its ascent had torn a lurid rent in the black
sky and had cast a red glare over the roaring sea.</p>

<p>Already boat No. 10 was loading up and men and boys
were busy with the ropes. I started to help near a davit
that seemed to be giving trouble but was sternly ordered
to get out of the way and to get into the boat.</p>

<p>Other passengers and members of the crew and officers
of the ship were rushing to and fro along the deck
strapping their life-preservers to them as they rushed.
There was some shouting of orders but little or no confusion.
One woman, a blonde French actress, became
hysterical on the deck, but two men lifted her bodily off
her feet and placed her in the life-boat.</p>

<p>We were on the port side of the ship, the higher side.
To reach the boats, we had to climb up the slanting deck
to the edge of the ship.</p>

<p>On the starboard side, it was different. On that side,
the decks slanted down toward the water. The ship
careened in that direction and the life-boats suspended
from the davits swung clear of the ship's side.</p>

<p>The list of the ship increased. On the port side, we
looked down the slanting side of the ship and noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
that her water line on that side was a number of feet
above the waves. The slant was so pronounced that the
life-boats, instead of swinging clear from the davits,
rested against the side of the ship. From my position
in the life-boat I could see that we were going to have
difficulty in the descent to the water.</p>

<p>"Lower away," some one gave the order and we started
downward with a jerk toward the seemingly hungry,
rising and falling swells. Then we stopped with another
jerk and remained suspended in mid-air while the men
at the bow and the stern swore and tusseled with the
ropes.</p>

<p>The stern of the boat was down; the bow up, leaving
us at an angle of about forty-five degrees. We clung
to the seats to save ourselves from falling out.</p>

<p>"Who's got a knife? A knife! A knife!" shouted
a fireman in the bow. He was bare to the waist and
perspiration stood out in drops on his face and chest and
made streaks through the coal dust with which his skin
was grimed.</p>

<p>"Great Gawd! Give him a knife," bawled a half-dressed
jibbering negro stoker who wrung his hands in
the stern.</p>

<p>A hatchet was thrust into my hands and I forwarded it
to the bow. There was a flash of sparks as it was
brought down with a clang on the holding pulley. One
strand of the rope parted.</p>

<p>Down plunged the bow of the boat too quickly for the
men in the stern. We came to a jerky stop, this time
with the stern in the air and the bow down, the dangerous
angle reversed.</p>

<p>One man in the stern let the rope race through his blistered
fingers. With hands burnt to the quick, he grabbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the rope and stopped the precipitous descent just in time
to bring the stern level with the bow.</p>

<p>Then bow and stern tried to lower away together. The
slant of the ship's side had increased, so that our boat
instead of sliding down it like a toboggan was held up
on one side when the taffrail caught on one of the condenser
exhaust pipes projecting slightly from the ship's
side.</p>

<p>Thus the starboard side of the life-boat stuck fast and
high while the port side dropped down and once more
we found ourselves clinging on at a new angle and looking
straight down into the water.</p>

<p>A hand slipped into mine and a voice sounded huskily
close to my ear. It was the little old Jewish travelling
man who was disliked in the smoke room because he
used to speak too certainly of things about which he
was uncertain. His slightly Teutonic dialect had made
him as popular as the smallpox with the British passengers.</p>

<p>"My poy, I can't see nutting," he said. "My glasses
slipped and I am falling. Hold me, please."</p>

<p>I managed to reach out and join hands with another
man on the other side of the old man and together we
held him in. He hung heavily over our arms, grotesquely
grasping all he had saved from his stateroom&mdash;a
gold-headed cane and an extra hat.</p>

<p>Many feet and hands pushed the boat from the side
of the ship and we renewed our sagging, scraping, sliding,
jerking descent. It ended as the bottom of the life-boat
smacked squarely on the pillowy top of a rising
swell. It felt more solid than mid-air at least.</p>

<p>But we were far from being off. The pulleys twice
stuck in their fastings, bow and stern, and the one axe
was passed forward and back (and with it my flashlight)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
as the entangling mesh of ropes that held us to the
sinking <i>Laconia</i> was cut away.</p>

<p>Some shout from that confusion of sound caused me
to look up. I believe I really did so in the fear that
one of the nearby boats was being lowered upon us.</p>

<p>Tin funnels enamelled white and containing clusters
of electric bulbs hung over the side from one of the upper
decks. I looked up into the cone of one of these lights
and a bulky object shot suddenly out of the darkness
into the scope of the electric rays.</p>

<p>It was a man. His arms were bent up at the elbows;
his legs at the knees. He was jumping, with the intention,
I feared, of landing in our boat, and I prepared to
avoid the impact. But he had judged his distance well.</p>

<p>He plunged beyond us and into the water three feet
from the edge of the boat. He sank from sight, leaving
a white patch of bubbles and foam on the black
water. He bobbed to the surface almost immediately.</p>

<p>"It's Dugan," shouted a man next to me.</p>

<p>I flashed a light on the ruddy, smiling face and water
plastered hair of the little Canadian aviator, our fellow
saloon passenger. We pulled him over the side and into
the boat. He spluttered out a mouthful of water.</p>

<p>"I wonder if there is anything to that lighting three
matches off the same match," he said. "I was trying to
loosen the bow rope in this boat. I loosened it and then
got tangled up in it. When the boat descended, I was
jerked up back on the deck. Then I jumped for it. Holy
Moses, but this water is cold."</p>

<p>As we pulled away from the side of the ship, its receding
terraces of glowing port holes and deck lights
towered above us. The ship was slowly turning over.</p>

<p>We were directly opposite the engine room section of
the <i>Laconia</i>. There was a tangle of oars, spars and rigging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
on the seats in our boat, and considerable confusion
resulted before we could manage to place in operation
some of the big oars on either side.</p>

<p>The jibbering, bullet-headed negro was pulling a
sweep directly behind me and I turned to quiet him as his
frantic reaches with the oar were jabbing me in the back.</p>

<p>In the dull light from the upper decks, I looked into
his slanting face&mdash;his eyes all whites and his lips moving
convulsively. He shivered with fright, but in addition
to that he was freezing in the thin cotton shirt that composed
his entire upper covering. He worked feverishly
at the oar to warm himself.</p>

<p>"Get away from her. My Gawd, get away from her,"
he kept repeating. "When the water hits her hot boilers
she'll blow up the whole ocean and there's just tons
and tons of shrapnel in her hold."</p>

<p>His excitement spread to other members of the crew
in our boat. The ship's baker, designated by his pantry
headgear of white linen, became a competing alarmist
and a white fireman, whose blasphemy was nothing short
of profound, added to the confusion by cursing every
one.</p>

<p>It was the tension of the minute&mdash;it was the give way
of overwrought nerves&mdash;it was bedlam and nightmare.</p>

<p>I sought to establish some authority in our boat which
was about to break out into full mutiny. I made my way
to the stern. There, huddled up in a great overcoat and
almost muffled in a ship's life-preserver, I came upon an
old white-haired man and I remembered him.</p>

<p>He was a sea-captain of the old sailing days. He had
been a second cabin passenger with whom I had talked
before. Earlier in the year he had sailed out of Nova
Scotia with a cargo of codfish. His schooner, the <i>Secret</i>,
had broken in two in mid-ocean, but he and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
crew had been picked up by a tramp and taken back to
New York.</p>

<p>From there he had sailed on another ship bound for
Europe, but this ship, a Holland-American Liner, the
<i>Ryndam</i>, had never reached the other side. In mid-Atlantic
her captain had lost courage over the U-boat
threats. He had turned the ship about and returned to
America. Thus, the <i>Laconia</i> represented the third unsuccessful
attempt of this grey-haired mariner to get
back to his home in England. His name was Captain
Dear.</p>

<p>"Our boat's rudder is gone, but we can stear with an
oar," he said, in a weak-quavering voice&mdash;the thin high-pitched
treble of age. "I will take charge, if you want
me to, but my voice is gone. I can tell you what to do,
but you will have to shout the orders. They won't listen
to me."</p>

<p>There was only one way to get the attention of the
crew, and that was by an overpowering blast of profanity.
I called to my assistance every ear-splitting,
soul-sizzling oath that I could think of.</p>

<p>I recited the lurid litany of the army mule skinner
to his gentle charges and embellished it with excerpts
from the remarks of a Chicago taxi chauffeur while he
changed tires on the road with the temperature ten
below.</p>

<p>It proved to be an effective combination, this brim-stoned
oration of mine, because it was rewarded by silence.</p>

<p>"Is there a ship's officer in this boat?" I shouted.
There was no answer.</p>

<p>"Is there a sailor or a seaman on board?" I inquired,
and again there was silence from our group of passengers,
firemen, stokers and deck swabs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>They appeared to be listening to me and I wished to
keep my hold on them. I racked my mind for some
other query to make or some order to direct. Before the
spell was broken I found one.</p>

<p>"We will now find out how many of us there are in
this boat," I announced in the best tones of authority
that I could assume. "The first man in the bow will
count one and the next man to him will count two. We
will count from the bow back to the stern, each man
taking a number. Begin."</p>

<p>"One," came the quick response from a passenger who
happened to be the first man in the bow. The enumeration
continued sharply toward the stern. I spoke the last
number.</p>

<p>"There are twenty-three of us here," I repeated,
"there's not a ship's officer or seaman among us, but we
are extremely fortunate to have with us an old sea-captain
who has consented to take charge of the boat and
save our lives. His voice is weak, but I will repeat the
orders for him, so that all of you can hear. Are you
ready to obey his orders?"</p>

<p>There was an almost unanimous acknowledgment of
assent and order was restored.</p>

<p>"The first thing to be done," I announced upon Captain
Dear's instructions, "is to get the same number of
oars pulling on each side of the boat; to seat ourselves
so as to keep on an even keel and then to keep the boat's
head up into the wind so that we won't be swamped by
the waves."</p>

<p>With some little difficulty, this rearrangement was accomplished
and then we rested on our oars with all eyes
turned on the still lighted <i>Laconia</i>. The torpedo had hit
at about 10:30 P. M. according to our ship's time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Though listing far over on one side, the <i>Laconia</i> was
still afloat.</p>

<p>It must have been twenty minutes after that first shot
that we heard another dull thud, which was accompanied
by a noticeable drop in the hulk. The German submarine
had despatched a second torpedo through the engine
room and the boat's vitals from a distance of two hundred
yards.</p>

<p>We watched silently during the next minute as the
tiers of lights dimmed slowly from white to yellow, then
to red and then nothing was left but the murky mourning
of the night which hung over all like a pall.</p>

<p>A mean, cheese-coloured crescent of a moon revealed
one horn above a rag bundle of clouds low in the distance.
A rim of blackness settled around our little
world, relieved only by a few leering stars in the zenith,
and, where the <i>Laconia's</i> lights had shown, there remained
only the dim outlines of a blacker hulk standing
out above the water like a jagged headland, silhouetted
against the overcast sky.</p>

<p>The ship sank rapidly at the stern until at last its nose
rose out of the water, and stood straight up in the air.
Then it slid silently down and out of sight like a piece of
scenery in a panorama spectacle.</p>

<p>Boat No. 3 stood closest to the place where the ship
had gone down. As a result of the after suction, the
small life-boat rocked about in a perilous sea of clashing
spars and wreckage.</p>

<p>As the boat's crew steadied its head into the wind, a
black hulk, glistening wet and standing about eight feet
above the surface of the water, approached slowly. It
came to a stop opposite the boat and not ten feet from
the side of it. It was the submarine.</p>

<p>"Vot ship vass dot?" were the first words of throaty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
guttural English that came from a figure which projected
from the conning tower.</p>

<p>"The <i>Laconia</i>," answered the Chief Steward Ballyn,
who commanded the life-boat.</p>

<p>"Vot?"</p>

<p>"The <i>Laconia</i>, Cunard Line," responded the steward.</p>

<p>"Vot did she weigh?" was the next question from the
submarine.</p>

<p>"Eighteen thousand tons."</p>

<p>"Any passengers?"</p>

<p>"Seventy-three," replied Ballyn, "many of them
women and children&mdash;some of them in this boat. She
had over two hundred in the crew."</p>

<p>"Did she carry cargo?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Iss der Captain in dot boat?"</p>

<p>"No," Ballyn answered.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you'll be all right. A patrol will pick
you up some time soon." Without further sound save
for the almost silent fixing of the conning tower lid, the
submarine moved off.</p>

<p>"I thought it best to make my answers sharp and satisfactory,
sir," said Ballyn, when he repeated the conversation
to me word for word. "I was thinking of the
women and children in the boat. I feared every minute
that somebody in our boat might make a hostile move,
fire a revolver, or throw something at the submarine. I
feared the consequence of such an act."</p>

<p>There was no assurance of an early pickup so we made
preparations for a siege with the elements. The weather
was a great factor. That black rim of clouds looked
ominous. There was a good promise of rain. February
has a reputation for nasty weather in the north Atlantic.
The wind was cold and seemed to be rising. Our boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
bobbed about like a cork on the swells, which fortunately
were not choppy.</p>

<p>How much rougher seas could the boat weather?
This question and conditions were debated pro and con.</p>

<p>Had our rockets been seen? Did the first torpedo put
the wireless out of commission? If it had been able to
operate, had anybody heard our S. O. S.? Was there
enough food and drinking water in the boat to last?</p>

<p>This brought us to an inventory of our small craft.
After considerable difficulty, we found the lamp, a can
of powder flares, the tin of ship's biscuit, matches and
spare oil.</p>

<p>The lamp was lighted. Other lights were now visible.
As we drifted in the darkness, we could see them every
time we mounted the crest of the swells. The boats
carrying these lights remained quite close together at
first.</p>

<p>One boat came within sound and I recognised the
Harry Lauder-like voice of the second assistant purser
whom I had last heard on Wednesday at the ship's concert.
Now he was singing&mdash;"I Want to Marry 'arry,"
and "I Love to be a Sailor."</p>

<p>There were an American woman and her husband in
that boat. She told me later that an attempt had been
made to sing "Tipperary," and "Rule Britannia," but
the thought of that slinking dark hull of destruction
that might have been a part of the immediate darkness
resulted in the abandonment of the effort.</p>

<p>"Who's the officer in that boat?" came a cheery hail
from the nearby light.</p>

<p>"What the hell is it to you?" our half frozen negro
yelled out for no reason apparent to me other than possibly
the relief of his feelings.</p>

<p>"Will somebody brain that skunk with a pin?" was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the inquiry of our profound oathsman, who also expressed
regret that he happened to be sitting too far away
from the negro to reach him. He accompanied the announcement
with a warmth of language that must have
relieved the negro of his chill.</p>

<p>The fear of the boats crashing together produced a
general inclination toward maximum separation on the
part of all the little units of survivors, with the result
that soon the small crafts stretched out for several miles,
their occupants all endeavoring to hold the heads of the
boats into the wind.</p>

<p>Hours passed. The swells slopped over the sides of
our boat and filled the bottom with water. We bailed it
continually. Most of us were wet to the knees and
shivering from the weakening effects of the icy water.
Our hands were blistered from pulling at the oars. Our
boat, bobbing about like a cork, produced terrific nausea,
and our stomachs ached from vain wrenching.</p>

<p>And then we saw the first light&mdash;the first sign of help
coming&mdash;the first searching glow of white radiance deep
down the sombre sides of the black pot of night that
hung over us. I don't know what direction it came
from&mdash;none of us knew north from south&mdash;there was
nothing but water and sky. But the light&mdash;it just came
from over there where we pointed. We nudged dumb, sick
boat mates and directed their gaze and aroused them to
an appreciation of the sight that gave us new life.</p>

<p>It was 'way over there&mdash;first a trembling quiver of
silver against the blackness, then drawing closer, it defined
itself as a beckoning finger, although still too far
away to see our feeble efforts to attract it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we wasted valuable flares and the ship's
baker, self-ordained custodian of the biscuit, did the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
honours handsomely to the extent of a biscuit apiece to
each of the twenty-three occupants of the boat.</p>

<p>"Pull starboard, sonnies," sang out old Captain Dear,
his grey chin whiskers bristling with joy in the light of
the round lantern which he held aloft.</p>

<p>We pulled&mdash;pulled lustily, forgetting the strain and
pain of innards torn and racked with violent vomiting, and
oblivious of blistered palms and wet, half-frozen feet.</p>

<p>Then a nodding of that finger of light,&mdash;a happy, snapping,
crap-shooting finger that seemed to say: "Come
on, you men," like a dice player wooing the bones&mdash;led us
to believe that our lights had been seen.</p>

<p>This was the fact, for immediately the oncoming vessel
flashed on its green and red sidelights and we saw it
was headed for our position. We floated off its stern
for a while as it man&oelig;uvred for the best position in which
it could take us on with a sea that was running higher
and higher.</p>

<p>The risk of that rescuing ship was great, because there
was every reason to believe that the submarine that had
destroyed the <i>Laconia</i> still lurked in the darkness nearby,
but those on board took the risk and stood by for the
work of rescue.</p>

<p>"Come along side port!" was megaphoned to us. As
fast as we could, we swung under the stern and felt our
way broadside toward the ship's side.</p>

<p>Out of the darkness above, a dozen small pocket flashlights
blinked down on us and orders began to be shouted
fast and thick.</p>

<p>When I look back on the night, I don't know which
was the more hazardous, going down the slanting side
of the sinking <i>Laconia</i> or going up the side of the rescuing
vessel.</p>

<p>One minute the swells would lift us almost level with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the rail of the low-built patrol boat and mine sweeper,
but the next receding wave would swirl us down into a
darksome gulf over which the ship's side glowered like
a slimy, dripping cliff.</p>

<p>A score of hands reached out and we were suspended
in the husky, tattooed arms of those doughty British Jack
Tars, looking up into their weather-beaten youthful
faces, mumbling our thankfulness and reading in the
gold lettering on their pancake hats the legend, "H. M.
S. <i>Laburnum</i>." We had been six hours in the open boat.</p>

<p>The others began coming alongside one by one. Wet
and bedraggled survivors were lifted aboard. Women
and children first was the rule.</p>

<p>The scenes of reunion were heart-gripping. Men who
had remained strangers to one another aboard the <i>Laconia</i>,
now wrung each other by the hand or embraced
without shame the frail little wife of a Canadian chaplain
who had found one of her missing children delivered
up from another boat. She smothered the child with
ravenous mother kisses while tears of gladness streamed
down her face.</p>

<p>Boat after boat came alongside. The water-logged
craft containing the Captain came last.</p>

<p>A rousing cheer went up as he stepped on the deck, one
mangled hand hanging limp at his side.</p>

<p>The sailors divested themselves of outer clothing and
passed the garments over to the shivering members of the
<i>Laconia's</i> crew.</p>

<p>The cramped officers' quarters down under the quarter
deck were turned over to the women and children.
Two of the <i>Laconia's</i> stewardesses passed boiling basins
of navy cocoa and aided in the disentangling of wet and
matted tresses.</p>

<p>The men grouped themselves near steam-pipes in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
petty officers' quarters or over the grating of the engine
rooms, where new life was to be had from the upward
blasts of heated air that brought with them the smell of
bilge water and oil and sulphur from the bowels of the
vessel.</p>

<p>The injured&mdash;all minor cases, sprained backs, wrenched
legs or mashed hands&mdash;were put away in bunks under
the care of the ship's doctor.</p>

<p>Dawn was melting the eastern ocean grey to pink when
the task was finished. In the officers' quarters, which
had now been invaded by the men, the roll of the vessel
was most perceptible. Each time the floor of the room
slanted, bottles and cups and plates rolled and slid back
and forth.</p>

<p>On the tables and chairs and benches the women rested.
Sea-sick mothers, trembling from the after-effects of the
terrifying experience of the night, sought to soothe their
crying children.</p>

<p>Then somebody happened to touch a key on the small
wooden organ that stood against one wall. This was
enough to send some callous seafaring fingers over the
ivory keys in a rhythm unquestionably religious and so
irresistible under the circumstances that, although no one
seemed to know the words, the air was taken up in a
reverent, humming chant by all in the room.</p>

<p>At the last note of the Amen, little Father Warring,
his black garb snaggled in places and badly soiled, stood
before the centre table and lifted back his head until the
morning light, filtering through the opened hatch above
him, shown down on his kindly, weary face. He recited
the Lord's prayer and all present joined. The simple, impressive
service of thanksgiving ended as simply as it had
begun.</p>

<p>Two minutes later I saw the old Jewish travelling man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
limping about on one lame leg with a little boy in his
arms. He was collecting big, round British pennies for
the youngster.</p>

<p>A survey and cruise of the nearby waters revealed no
more occupied boats and our mine sweeper, with its load
of survivors numbering two hundred and sixty-seven,
steamed away to the east. A half an hour steaming and
the vessel stopped within hailing distance of two sister
ships, toward one of which an open boat manned by
jackies was being pulled.</p>

<p>I saw the hysterical French actress, her blonde hair
wet and bedraggled, lifted out of the boat and carried
up the companionway. Then a little boy, his fresh pink
face and golden hair shining in the morning sun, was
passed upward, followed by some other survivors, numbering
fourteen in all, who had been found half-drowned
and almost dead from exposure in a partially wrecked
boat that was picked up just as it was sinking. It was
in that boat that one American woman and her daughter
died. One of the survivors of the boat told me the
story. He said:</p>

<p>"Our boat was No. 8. It was smashed in the lowering.
I was in the bow. Mrs. Hoy and her daughter were sitting
toward the stern. The boat filled with water rapidly.</p>

<p>"It was no use trying to bail it out. There was a
big hole in the side and it came in too fast. The boat's
edge sank to the level of the water and only the air-tanks
kept it afloat.</p>

<p>"It was completely awash. Every swell rode clear
over our heads and we had to hold our breath until we
came to the surface again. The cold water just takes
the life out of you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"We saw the other boats showing their lights and
drifting further and further away from us. We had no
lights. And then, towards morning, we saw the rescuing
ship come up into the cluster of other life-boats that had
drifted so far away from us. One by one we saw their
lights disappear as they were taken on board.</p>

<p>"We shouted and screamed and shrieked at the tops of
our voices, but could not attract the attention of any of
the other boats or the rescuing ship, and soon we saw
its lights blink out. We were left there in the darkness
with the wind howling and the sea rolling higher every
minute.</p>

<p>"The women got weaker and weaker. Maybe they had
been dead for some time. I don't know, but a wave came
and washed both Mrs. Hoy and her daughter out of the
boat. There were life-belts around their bodies and they
drifted away with their arms locked about one another."</p>

<p>With such stories ringing in our ears, with exchanges
of experiences pathetic and humorous, we steamed into
Queenstown harbour shortly after ten o'clock that night.
We had been attacked at a point two hundred miles off
the Irish coast and of our passengers and crew, thirteen
had been lost.</p>

<p>As I stepped ashore, a Britisher, a fellow-passenger
aboard the <i>Laconia</i>, who knew me as an American,
stepped up to me. During the voyage we had had many
conversations concerning the possibility of America entering
the war. Now he slapped me on the back with
this question,</p>

<p>"Well, old Casus Belli," he said, "is this your blooming
overt act?"</p>

<p>I did not answer him, but thirty minutes afterward
I was pounding out on a typewriter the introduction to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
four thousand word newspaper article which I cabled
that night and which put the question up to the American
public for an answer.</p>

<p>Five weeks later the United States entered the war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>PERSHING'S ARRIVAL IN EUROPE</h3>


<p>Lean, clean, keen&mdash;that's the way they looked&mdash;that
first trim little band of American fighting men who
made their historic landing on the shores of England,
June 8th, 1917.</p>

<p>I went down from London to meet them at the port
of arrival. In my despatches of that date, I, nor none of
the other correspondents, was permitted to mention the
name of the port. This was supposed to be the secret
that was to be religiously kept and the British censor
was on the job religiously.</p>

<p>The name of the port was excluded from all American
despatches but the British censor saw no reason to
withhold transmission of the following sentence&mdash;"Pershing
landed to-day at an English port and was given
a hearty welcome by the Mayor of Liverpool."</p>

<p>So I am presuming at this late date of writing that
it would serve no further purpose to refrain from announcing
flatly that General John J. Pershing, Commander-in-Chief
of the American Expeditionary Forces
overseas, and his staff, landed on the date above mentioned,
at Liverpool, England.</p>

<p>The sun was shining brightly on the Mersey when the
giant ocean liner, the <i>Baltic</i>, came slowly up the harbour
in the tow of numerous puffing tugs. The great grey
vessel that had safely completed the crossing of the submarine
zone, was warped to the dock-side.</p>

<p>On the quay there were a full brass band and an honourary
escort of British soldiers. While the moorings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
were being fastened, General Pershing, with his staff,
appeared on the promenade deck on the shore side of
the vessel.</p>

<p>His appearance was the signal for a crash of cymbals
and drums as the band blared out the "Star Spangled
Banner." The American commander and the officers
ranged in line on either side of him, stood stiffly at attention,
with right hands raised in salute to the visors
of their caps.</p>

<p>On the shore the lines of British soldiery brought their
arms to the present with a snap. Civilian witnesses of
the ceremony bared their heads. The first anthem was
followed by the playing of "God Save the King." All
present remained at the salute.</p>

<p>As the gangplank was lashed in place, a delegation
of British military and civilian officials boarded the ship
and were presented to the General. Below, on the dock,
every newspaper correspondent and photographer in the
British Isles, I think, stood waiting in a group that far
outnumbered the other spectators.</p>

<p>There was reason for this seeming lack of proportion.
The fact was that but very few people in all of England,
as well as in all of the United States, had known that
General Pershing was to land that day.</p>

<p>Few had known that he was on the water. The British
Admiralty, then in complete control of the ocean lines
between America and the British Isles, had guarded well
the secret. England lost Kitchener on the sea and now
with the sea peril increased a hundredfold, England took
pains to guard well the passage of this standard-bearer
of the American millions that were to come.</p>

<p>Pershing and his staff stepped ashore. Lean, clean,
keen&mdash;those are the words that described their appearance.
That was the way they impressed their critical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
brothers in arms, the all-observing military dignities that
presented Britain's hearty, unreserved welcome at the
water's edge. That was the way they appeared to the
proud American citizens, residents of those islands, who
gathered to meet them.</p>

<p>The British soldiers admired the height and shoulders
of our first military samples. The British soldier approves
of a greyhound trimness in the belt zone. He
likes to look on carriage and poise. He appreciates a
steady eye and stiff jaw. He is attracted by a voice
that rings sharp and firm. The British soldier calls such
a combination, "a real soldier."</p>

<p>He saw one, and more than one, that morning shortly
after nine o'clock when Pershing and his staff committed
the date to history by setting foot on British soil.
Behind the American commander walked a staff of American
officers whose soldierly bearing and general appearance
brought forth sincere expressions of commendation
from the assemblage on the quay.</p>

<p>At attention on the dock, facing the sea-stained flanks
of the liner <i>Baltic</i>, a company of Royal Welsh Fusiliers
Stood like a frieze of clay models in stainless khaki, polished
brass and shining leather.</p>

<p>General Pershing inspected the guard of honour with
keen interest. Walking beside the American commander
was the considerably stouter and somewhat shorter Lieutenant
General Sir William Pitcairn Campbell, K.C.B.,
Chief of the Western Command of the British Home
Forces.</p>

<p>Pershing's inspection of that guard was not the cursory
one that these honourary affairs usually are. Not a
detail of uniform or equipment on any of the men in the
guard was overlooked. The American commander's attention
was as keen to boots, rifles and belts, as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
he had been a captain preparing the small command for
a strenuous inspection at the hands of some exacting
superior.</p>

<p>As he walked down the stiff, standing line, his keen
blue eyes taking in each one of the men from head to
foot, he stopped suddenly in front of one man in the
ranks. That man was File Three in the second set of
fours. He was a pale-faced Tommy and on one of his
sleeves there was displayed two slender gold bars, placed
on the forearm.</p>

<p>The decoration was no larger than two matches in a
row and on that day it had been in use hardly more than
a year, yet neither its minuteness nor its meaning escaped<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">the eyes of the American commander.</span><br /></p>

<p>Pershing turned sharply and faced File Three.</p>

<p>"Where did you get your two wounds?" he asked.</p>

<p>"At Givenchy and Lavenze, sir," replied File Three,
his face pointed stiffly ahead. File Three, even now
under twenty-one years of age, had received his wounds
in the early fighting that is called the battle of Loos.</p>

<p>"You are a man," was the sincere, all-meaning rejoinder
of the American commander, who accompanied
his remark with a straightforward look into the eyes of
File Three.</p>

<p>Completing the inspection without further incident,
General Pershing and his staff faced the honour guard
and stood at the salute, while once more the thunderous
military band played the national anthems of America
and Great Britain.</p>

<p>The ceremony was followed by a reception in the
cabin of the <i>Baltic</i>, where General Pershing received the
Lord Mayor of Liverpool, the Lady Mayoress, and a delegation<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">of civil authorities. The reception ended when</span><br />
General Pershing spoke a few simple words to the assembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
representatives of the British and American
Press.</p>

<p>"More of us are coming," was the keynote of his modest
remarks. Afterward he was escorted to the quay-side
station, where a special train of the type labelled
Semi-Royal was ready to make the express run to London.</p>

<p>The reception at the dock had had none of the features
of a demonstration by reason of the necessity for the
ship's arrival being secret, but as soon as the <i>Baltic</i> had
landed, the word of the American commander's arrival
spread through Liverpool like wildfire.</p>

<p>The railroad from the station lay through an industrial
section of the city. Through the railroad warehouses
the news had preceded the train. Warehouse-men,
porters and draymen crowded the tops of the cotton bales
and oil barrels on both sides of the track as the
train passed through.</p>

<p>Beyond the sheds, the news had spread through the
many floors of the flour mills and when the Pershing
train passed, handkerchiefs and caps fluttered from every
crowded door and window in the whitened walls. Most
of the waving was done by a new kind of flour-girl, one
who did not wave an apron because none of them were
dressed that way.</p>

<p>From his car window, General Pershing returned the
greetings of the trousered girls and women who were
making England's bread while their husbands, fathers,
brothers, sweethearts and sons were making German
cemeteries.</p>

<p>In London, General Pershing and his staff occupied
suites at the Savoy Hotel, and during the four or five
days of the American commander's sojourn in the capital
of the British Empire, a seemingly endless line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
visitors of all the Allied nationalities called to present
their compliments.</p>

<p>The enlisted men of the General's staff occupied quarters
in the old stone barracks of the Tower of London,
where they were the guests of the men of that artillery
organisation which prefixes an "Honourable" to its name
and has been assigned for centuries to garrison duty in
the Tower of London.</p>

<p>Our soldiers manifested naïve interest in some of
England's most revered traditions and particularly in
connection with historical events related to the Tower
of London. On the second day of their occupation of
this old fortress, one of the warders, a "Beef-eater" in
full mediæval regalia, was escorting a party of the Yanks
through the dungeons.</p>

<p>He stopped in one dungeon and lined the party up in
front of a stone block in the centre of the floor. After
a silence of a full minute to produce a proper degree of
impressiveness for the occasion, the warder announced,
in a respectful whisper:</p>

<p>"This is where Anne Boleyn was executed."</p>

<p>The lined-up Yanks took a long look at the stone block.
A silence followed during the inspection. And then one
regular, desiring further information, but not wishing
to be led into any traps of British wit, said:</p>

<p>"All right, I'll bite; what did Annie do?"</p>

<p>Current with the arrival of our men and their reception
by the honour guard of the Welsh Fusiliers there
was a widespread revival of an old story which the
Americans liked to tell in the barrack rooms at night.</p>

<p>When the Welsh Fusiliers received our men at the
dock of Liverpool, they had with them their historical
mascot, a large white goat with horns encased in inscribed
silver. The animal wore suspended from its neck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
a large silver plate, on which was inscribed a partial history
of the Welsh Fusiliers.</p>

<p>Some of these Fusiliers told our men the story.</p>

<p>"It was our regiment&mdash;the Welsh Fusiliers," one of
them said, "that fought you Yanks at Bunker Hill. And
it was at Bunker Hill that our regiment captured the
great-great-granddaddy of this same white goat, and his
descendants are ever destined to be the mascot of our
regiment. You see, we have still got your goat."</p>

<p>"But you will notice," replied one of the Yanks, "we've
got the hill."</p>

<p>During the four days in London, General Pershing
was received by King George and Queen Mary at Buckingham
Palace. The American commander engaged in
several long conferences at the British War Office, and
then with an exclusion of entertainment that was painful
to the Europeans, he made arrangements to leave for
his new post in France.</p>

<p>A specially written permission from General Pershing
made it possible for me to accompany him on that historic
crossing between England and France. Secret orders
for the departure were given on the afternoon and
evening of June 12th. Before four o'clock of the next
morning, June 13th, I breakfasted in the otherwise deserted
dining-room of the Savoy with the General and
his staff.</p>

<p>Only a few sleepy-eyed attendants were in the halls
and lower rooms of the Savoy. In closed automobiles
we were whisked away to Charing Cross Station. We
boarded a special train whose destination was unknown.
The entire party was again in the hands of the Intelligence
Section of the British Admiralty, and every possible
means was taken to suppress all definite information
concerning the departure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>The special train containing General Pershing and his
staff reached Folkstone at about seven o'clock in the
morning. We left the train at the dockside and boarded
the swift Channel steamer moored there. A small vociferous
contingent of English Tommies returning to the
front from leave in "Blighty" were crowded on all decks
in the stern.</p>

<p>With life-boats swinging out over the side and every
one wearing life-preservers, we steamed out of Folkstone
harbour to challenge the submarine dangers of the
Channel.</p>

<p>The American commander occupied a forward cabin
suite on the upper deck. His aides and secretaries had
already transformed it into a business-like apartment.
In the General's mind there was no place or time for any
consideration of the dangers of the Channel crossing.
Although the very waters through which we dashed were
known to be infested with submarines which would have
looked upon him as capital prey, I don't believe the General
ever gave them as much as a thought.</p>

<p>Every time I looked through the open door of his
cabin, he was busy dictating letters to his secretaries or
orders or instructions to his aides or conferring with his
Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Harbord. To the
American commander, the hours necessary for the dash
across the Channel simply represented a little more time
which he could devote to the plans for the great work
ahead of him.</p>

<p>Our ship was guarded on all sides and above. Swift
torpedo destroyers dashed to and fro under our bow and
stern and circled us continually. In the air above hydro-airplanes
and dirigible balloons hovered over the waters
surrounding us, keeping sharp watch for the first appearance
of the dark sub-sea hulks of destruction.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p><p>We did not learn until the next day that while we were
making that Channel crossing, the German air forces had
crossed the Channel in a daring daylight raid and were
at that very hour dropping bombs on London around the
very hotel which General Pershing had just vacated.
Some day, after the war, I hope to ascertain whether the
commander of that flight of bombing Gothas started on
his expedition over London with a special purpose in
view and whether that purpose concerned the supposed
presence there of the commander-in-chief of the American
millions that were later to change the entire complexion
of the war against Germany.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful sunlight day. It was not long before
the coast line of France began to push itself up
through the distant Channel mists and make itself visible
on the horizon. I stood in the bow of the ship looking
toward the coast line and silent with thoughts concerning
the momentousness of the approaching historical
event.</p>

<p>It happened that I looked back amidships and saw a
solitary figure standing on the bridge of the vessel. It
was General Pershing. He seemed rapt in deep thought.
He wore his cap straight on his head, the visor shading
his eyes. He stood tall and erect, his hands behind him,
his feet planted slightly apart to accommodate the gentle
roll of the ship.</p>

<p>He faced due east and his eyes were directed toward
the shores of that foreign land which we were approaching.
It seemed to me as I watched him that his mind
must have been travelling back more than a century to
that day in history when another soldier had stood on
the bridge of another vessel, crossing those same waters,
but in an almost opposite direction.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that he must have been thinking of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
that historical character who made just such a journey
more than a hundred years before,&mdash;a great soldier who
left his homeland to sail to other foreign shores halfway
around the world and there to lend his sword in the fight
for the sacred principles of Democracy. It seemed to
me that day that Pershing thought of Lafayette.</p>

<p>As we drew close to the shore, I noticed an enormous
concrete breakwater extending out from the harbour entrance.
It was surmounted by a wooden railing and on
the very end of it, straddling the rail, was a small French
boy. His legs were bare and his feet were encased in
heavy wooden shoes. On his head he wore a red stocking
cap of the liberty type. As we came within hailing
distance, he gave to us the first greeting that came from
the shores of France to these first arriving American
soldiers.</p>

<p>"<i>Vive l'Amérique!</i>" he shouted, cupping his hands to
his mouth and sending his shrill voice across the water
to us. Pershing on the bridge heard the salutation. He
smiled, touched his hand to his hat and waved to the lad
on the railing.</p>

<p>We landed that day at Boulogne, June 13th, 1917.
Military bands massed on the quay, blared out the American
National Anthem as the ship was warped alongside
the dock. Other ships in the busy harbour began blowing
whistles and ringing bells, loaded troop and hospital
ships lying nearby burst forth into cheering. The news
spread like contagion along the harbour front.</p>

<p>As the gangplank was lowered, French military dignitaries
in dress uniforms resplendent with gold braid, buttons
and medals, advanced to that part of the deck amidships
where the General stood. They saluted respectfully
and pronounced elaborate addresses in their native tongue.
They were followed by numerous French Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
officials in civilian dress attire. The city, the department
and the nation were represented in the populous
delegations who presented their compliments, and conveyed
to the American commander the of the entire people of France.</p>

<p>Under the train sheds on the dock, long stiff, standing
ranks of French poilus wearing helmets and their light
blue overcoats pinned back at the knees, presented arms
as the General walked down the lines inspecting them.
At one end of the line, rank upon rank of French marines,
and sailors with their flat hats with red tassels, stood
at attention awaiting inspection.</p>

<p>The docks and train sheds were decorated with French
and American flags and yards and yards of the mutually-owned
red, white and blue. Thousands of spectators
began to gather in the streets near the station, and their
continuous cheers sufficed to rapidly augment their own
numbers.</p>

<p>Accompanied by a veteran French colonel, one of
whose uniform sleeves was empty, General Pershing, as
a guest of the city of Boulogne, took a motor ride through
the streets of this busy port city. He was quickly returned
to the station, where he and his staff boarded a
special train for Paris. I went with them.</p>

<p>That train to Paris was, of necessity, slow. It proceeded
slowly under orders and with a purpose. No one
in France, with the exception of a select official circle,
had been aware that General Pershing was arriving that
day until about thirty minutes before his ship was warped
into the dock at Boulogne. It has always been a mystery
to me how the French managed to decorate the station
at Boulogne upon such short notice.</p>

<p>Thus it was that the train crawled slowly toward
Paris for the purpose of giving the French capital time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
to throw off the coat of war weariness that it had worn
for three and a half years and don gala attire for this
occasion. Paris made full use of every minute of that
time, as we found when the train arrived at the French
capital late in the afternoon. The evening papers in
Paris had carried the news of the American commander's
landing on the shores of France, and Paris was
ready to receive him as Paris had never before received
a world's notable.</p>

<p>The sooty girders of the Gare du Nord shook with
cheers when the special train pulled in. The aisles of the
great terminal were carpeted with red plush. A battalion
of bearded poilus of the Two Hundred and Thirty-seventh
Colonial Regiment was lined up on the platform like
a wall of silent grey, bristling with bayonets and shiny
trench helmets.</p>

<p>General Pershing stepped from his private car. Flashlights
boomed and batteries of camera men man&oelig;uvred
into positions for the lens barrage. The band of the
Garde Républicaine blared forth the strains of the "Star
Spangled Banner," bringing all the military to a halt and
a long standing salute. It was followed by the "Marseillaise."</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the train-side greetings and introductions,
Marshal Joffre and General Pershing walked
down the platform together. The tops of the cars of
every train in the station were crowded with workmen.
As the tall, slender American commander stepped into
view, the privileged observers on the car-tops began to
cheer.</p>

<p>A minute later, there was a terrific roar from beyond
the walls of the station. The crowds outside had heard
the cheering within. They took it up with thousands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
throats. They made their welcome a ringing one. Paris
took Pershing by storm.</p>

<p>The General was ushered into the specially decorated
reception chamber, which was hung and carpeted with
brilliant red velvet and draped with the Allied flags.
After a brief formal exchange of greetings in this large
chamber, he and his staff were escorted to the line of
waiting automobiles at the side of the station in the Rue
de Roubaix.</p>

<p>Pershing's appearance in the open was the cue for
wild, unstinted applause and cheering from the crowds
which packed the streets and jammed the windows of the
tall buildings opposite.</p>

<p>General Pershing and M. Painlevé, Minister of War,
took seats in a large automobile. They were preceded
by a motor containing United States Ambassador Sharp
and former Premier Viviani. The procession started to
the accompaniment of martial music by massed military
bands in the courtyard of the station. It passed through
the Rue de Compiègne, the Rue de Lafayette, the Place
de l'Opéra, the Boulevard des Capucines, the Place de la
Madeleine, the Rue Royale, to the Place de la Concorde.</p>

<p>There were some fifty automobiles in the line, the rear
of which was brought up by an enormous motor-bus
load of the first American soldiers from the ranks to
pass through the streets of Paris.</p>

<p>The crowds overflowed the sidewalks. They extended
from the building walls out beyond the curbs and into
the streets, leaving but a narrow lane through which the
motors pressed their way slowly and with the exercise of
much care. From the crowded balconies and windows
overlooking the route, women and children tossed down
showers of flowers and bits of coloured paper.</p>

<p>The crowds were so dense that other street traffic became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
marooned in the dense sea of joyously excited and
gesticulating French people. Vehicles thus marooned immediately
became islands of vantage. They were soon
covered with men and women and children, who climbed
on top of them and clung to the sides to get a better look
at the khaki-clad occupants of the autos.</p>

<p>Old grey-haired fathers of French fighting men bared
their heads and with tears streaming down their cheeks
shouted greetings to the tall, thin, grey-moustached
American commander who was leading new armies to
the support of their sons. Women heaped armfuls of
roses into the General's car and into the cars of other
American officers that followed him. Paris street gamins
climbed the lamp-posts and waved their caps and wooden
shoes and shouted shrilly.</p>

<p>American flags and red, white and blue bunting waved
wherever the eye rested. English-speaking Frenchmen
proudly explained to the uninformed that "Pershing"
was pronounced "Peur-chigne" and not "Pair-shang."</p>

<p>Paris was not backward in displaying its knowledge of
English. Gay Parisiennes were eager to make use of all
the English at their command, that they might welcome
the new arrivals in their native tongue.</p>

<p>Some of these women shouted "Hello," "Heep, heep,
hourrah," "Good morning," "How are you, keed?" and
"Cock-tails for two." Some of the expressions were not
so inappropriate as they sounded.</p>

<p>Occasionally there came from the crowds a good old
genuine American whoop-em-up yell. This happened
when the procession passed groups of American ambulance
workers and other sons of Uncle Sam, wearing the
uniforms of the French, Canadian and English Corps.</p>

<p>They joined with Australians and South African soldiers
on leave to cheer on the new-coming Americans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
with such spontaneous expressions as "Come on, you
Yanks," "Now let's get 'em," and "Eat 'em up, Uncle
Sam."</p>

<p>The frequent stopping of the procession by the crowds
made it happen quite frequently that the automobiles
were completely surrounded by enthusiasts, who reached
up and tried to shake hands with the occupants. Pretty
girls kissed their hands and blew the invisible confection
toward the men in khaki.</p>

<p>The bus-load of enlisted men bringing up the rear
received dozens of bouquets from the girls. The flowers
were hurled at them from all directions. Every two
hundred feet the French would organise a rousing shout,
"<i>Vive l'Amérique!</i>" for them.</p>

<p>Being the passive recipients of this unusual adulation
produced only embarrassment on the part of the regulars
who simply had to sit there, smiling and taking it. Just
to break the one-sided nature of the demonstrations, one
of the enlisted men stood up in his seat and, addressing
himself to his mates, shouted:</p>

<p>"Come on, fellows, let's give 'em a 'veever' ourselves.
Now all together."</p>

<p>The bus-load rose to its feet like one man and shouted
"Veever for France." Their "France" rhymed with
"pants," so that none of the French understood it, but
they did understand the sentiment behind the husky
American lungs.</p>

<p>Through such scenes as these, the procession reached
the great Place de la Concorde. In this wide, paved, open
space an enormous crowd had assembled. As the autos
appeared the cheering, the flower throwing, the tumultuous
kiss-blowing began. It increased in intensity as the
motors stopped in front of the Hôtel Crillon into which
General Pershing disappeared, followed by his staff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Immediately the cheering changed to a tremendous
clamorous demand for the General's appearance on the
balcony in front of his apartments.</p>

<p>"<i>Au balcon, au balcon</i>," were the cries that filled the
Place. The crowd would not be denied.</p>

<p>General Pershing stepped forth on the balcony. He
stood behind the low marble railing, and between two
enormous white-stoned columns. A cluster of the Allied
flags was affixed to each column. The American commander
surveyed the scene in front of him.</p>

<p>There are no trees or shrubbery in the vast Place de
la Concorde. Its broad paved surface is interrupted only
by artistically placed groups of statuary and fountains.</p>

<p>To the General's right, as he faced the Place, were the
trees and greenery of the broad Champs Elysées. On
his left were the fountains and the gardens of the Tuilleries.
At the further end of the Place, five hundred feet
straight in front of him, were the banks and the ornamental
bridges of the Seine, beyond which could be seen
the columned façade of the Chambre des Deputies, and
above and beyond that, against the blue sky of a late
June afternoon, rose the majestic golden dome of the
Invalides, over the tomb of Napoleon.</p>

<p>General Pershing looked down upon the sea of faces
turned up toward him, and then it seemed that nature
desired to play a part in the ceremony of that great day.
A soft breeze from the Champs Elysées touched the cluster
of flags on the General's right and from all the Allied
emblems fastened there it selected one flag.</p>

<p>The breeze tenderly caught the folds of this flag and
wafted them across the balcony on which the General
bowed. He saw and recognised that flag. He extended
his hand, caught the flag in his fingers and pressed it to
his lips. All France and all America represented in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
vast throng that day cheered to the mighty echo when
Pershing kissed the tri-colour of France.</p>

<p>It was a tremendous, unforgettable incident. It was
exceeded by no other incident during those days of receptions
and ceremonies, except one. That was an incident
which occurred not in the presence of thousands,
but in a lonely old burial ground on the outskirts of
Paris. This happened several days after the demonstration
in the Place de la Concorde.</p>

<p>On that day of bright sunshine, General Pershing and
a small party of officers, French and American, walked
through the gravel paths of Picpus Cemetery in the suburbs
of Paris, where the bodies of hundreds of those
who made the history of France are buried.</p>

<p>Several French women in deep mourning courtesied as
General Pershing passed. His party stopped in front of
two marble slabs that lay side by side at the foot of a
granite monument. From the General's party a Frenchman
stepped forward and, removing his high silk hat, he
addressed the small group in quiet, simple tones and well-chosen
English words. He was the Marquis de Chambrun.
He said:</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p>"On this spot one can say that the historic ties between
our nations are not the result of the able schemes
of skilful diplomacy. No, the principles of liberty, justice
and independence are the glorious links between our
nations.</p>

<p>"These principles have enlisted the hearts of our democracies.
They have made the strength of their union
and have brought about the triumph of their efforts.</p>

<p>"To-day, when, after nearly a century and a half,
America and France are engaged in a conflict for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
same cause upon which their early friendship was based,
we are filled with hope and confidence.</p>

<p>"We know that our great nations are together with
our Allies invincible, and we rejoice to think that the
United States and France are reunited in the fight for
liberty, and will reconsecrate, in a new victory, their everlasting
friendship of which your presence to-day at this
grave is an exquisite and touching token."</p></div>

<p>General Pershing advanced to the tomb and placed
upon the marble slab an enormous wreath of pink and
white roses. Then he stepped back. He removed his
cap and held it in both hands in front of him. The
bright sunlight shone down on his silvery grey hair.
Looking down at the grave, he spoke in a quiet, impressive
tone four simple, all-meaning words:</p>

<p class='blockquot'>"Lafayette, we are here."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE LANDING OF THE FIRST AMERICAN CONTINGENT IN FRANCE</h3>


<p>The first executive work of the American Expeditionary
Forces overseas was performed in a second floor
suite of the Crillon Hotel on the Place de la Concorde in
Paris. This suite was the first temporary headquarters
of the American commander.</p>

<p>The tall windows of the rooms looked down on the
historic Place which was the scene of so many momentous
events in French history. The windows were hardly a
hundred yards from the very spot where the guillotine
dripped red in the days of the Terror. It was here that
the heads of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette dropped
into the basket.</p>

<p>During General Pershing's comparatively brief occupancy
of these headquarters, the reception rooms were
constantly banked with fresh-cut flowers, the daily gifts
of the French people,&mdash;flowers that were replenished
every twenty-four hours. The room was called the
"Salon des Batailles."</p>

<p>In one corner of the room, near a window overlooking
the Place, was General Pershing's table. It was adorned
with a statuette of General Joffre and a cluster of miniatures
of captured German standards. Extending from
the floor to the ceiling on one of the walls were two enormous
oil copies of "La Bataille de Fontenoy" and the
"Passage du Rhin." A large flag-draped photograph of
President Wilson occupied a place of honour on an easel
at one end of the room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>During the first week that General Pershing stopped
at the hotel, the sidewalk and street beneath his windows
were constantly crowded with people. The crowds
waited there all day long, just in the hope of catching
a glimpse of the American commander if he should happen
to be leaving or returning to his quarters. It seemed
as if every Parisienne and Parisian had taken upon herself
and himself the special duty of personally observing
General Pershing, of waving him an enthusiastic "vive"
and possibly being within the scope of his returning salute.</p>

<p>But the American commander would not permit demonstrations
and celebrations to interfere with the important
duties that he faced. Two days are all that were devoted
to these social ceremonies which the enthusiastic
and hospitable French would have made almost endless.
Dinners, receptions and parades were ruthlessly erased
from the working day calendar. The American commander
sounded the order "To work" with the same
martial precision as though the command had been a
sudden call "To arms."</p>

<p>On the morning of the third day after General Pershing's
arrival in Paris, the typewriters began clicking
incessantly and the telephones began ringing busily in the
large building which was occupied on that day as the
headquarters of the American Expeditionary Forces in
France.</p>

<p>This building was Numbers 27 and 31 Rue de Constantine.
It faced the trees and shrubbery bordering the
approach to the Seine front of the Invalides. The building
was two stories high with grey-white walls and a
mansard roof. At that time it could be immediately
identified as the one in front of which stood a line of
American motor cars, as the one where trim United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
States regulars walked sentry post past the huge doors
through which frequent orderlies dashed with messages.</p>

<p>Ten days before, the building had been the residence of
a Marquis and had contained furniture and art valued
at millions of francs. All of those home-like characteristics
had been removed so effectively that even the name
of the kindly Marquis had been forgotten. I am sure
that he, himself, at the end of that ten-day period could
not have recognised his converted salons where the elaborate
ornamentation had been changed to the severe simplicity
typical of a United States Army barracks.</p>

<p>General Pershing's office was located on the second
floor of the house and in one corner. In those early
days it was carpetless and contained almost a monkish
minimum of furniture. There were the General's chair,
and his desk on which there stood a peculiar metal standard
for one of those one-piece telephone sets with which
Americans are familiar only in French stage settings. A
book-case with glass doors, a stenographer's table and
chair, and two red plush upholstered chairs, for visitors,
comprised the furniture inventory of the room.</p>

<p>One of the inner walls of the room was adorned with
a large mirror with a gilt frame, and in the other wall
was a plain fireplace. There were tall windows in the
two outer walls which looked out on the Rue de Constantine
and the Rue de Grenelle. Opposite the Rue de
Grenelle windows there was a small, deeply shaded park
where children rolled hoops during the heat of the day
and where convalescent French soldiers sat and watched
the children at play or perhaps discussed the war and
other things with the nurse-maids.</p>

<p>This was the first workshop in France of the American
commander-in-chief. Adjoining rooms to the left
and right were occupied by the General's staff and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
aides. And it was in these rooms that the overseas plans
for the landing of the first American armed contingent
in France were formulated.</p>

<p>It is safe now to mention that St. Nazaire on the west
coast of France was the port at which our first armed
forces disembarked. I was in Paris when the information
of their coming was whispered to a few chosen
correspondents who were to be privileged to witness this
historical landing.</p>

<p>This was the first time in the history of our nation
that a large force of armed Americans was to cross the
seas to Europe. For five and a half months prior to the
date of their landing, the ruthless submarine policy of
the Imperial German Government had been in effect, and
our troop ships with those initial thousands of American
soldiers represented the first large Armada to dare the
ocean crossing since Germany had instituted her sub-sea
blockade zone in February of that same year.</p>

<p>Thus it was that any conversation concerning the fact
that our men were on the seas and at the mercy of the
U-boats was conducted with the greatest of care behind
closed doors. In spite of the efforts of the French agents
of contra espionage, Paris and all France, for that matter,
housed numerous spies. There were some anxious
moments while that first contingent was on the water.</p>

<p>Our little group of correspondents was informed that
we should be conducted by American officers to the port
of landing, but the name of that port was withheld from
us. By appointment we met at a Paris railroad station
where we were provided with railroad tickets. We took
our places in compartments and rode for some ten or
twelve hours, arriving early the next morning at St.
Nazaire.</p>

<p>This little village on the coast of Brittany was tucked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
away there in the golden sands of the seashore. Its
houses had walls of white stucco and gabled roofs of
red tile. In the small rolling hills behind it were green
orchards and fields of yellow wheat. The villagers, old
women in their starched white head-dresses and old men
wearing faded blue smocks and wooden shoes, were unmindful
of the great event for which history had destined
their village.</p>

<p>On the night before the landing the townspeople had
retired with no knowledge of what was to happen on
the following day. In the morning they awoke to find
strange ships that had come in the night, riding safely
at anchor in the harbour. The wooden shutters began
to pop open with bangs as excited heads, encased in
peaked flannel nightcaps, protruded themselves from bedroom
windows and directed anxious queries to those who
happened to be abroad at that early hour.</p>

<p>St. Nazaire came to life more quickly that morning
than ever before in its history. The Mayor of the town
was one of the busiest figures on the street. In high hat
and full dress attire, he hurried about trying to assemble
the village orchestra of octogenarian fiddlers and flute
players to play a welcome for the new arrivals. The
townspeople neglected their <i>café au lait</i> to rush down to
the quay to look at the new ships.</p>

<p>The waters of the harbour sparkled in the early morning
sunlight. The dawn had been grey and misty, but
now nature seemed to smile. The strange ships from
the other side of the world were grey in hulk but now
there were signs of life and colour aboard each one of
them.</p>

<p>Beyond the troop ships lay the first United States warships,
units of that remarkable fighting organisation
which in the year that was to immediately follow that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
very day were to escort safely across three thousand
miles of submarine-infested water more than a million
and a half American soldiers.</p>

<p>The appearance of these first warships of ours was
novel to the French townspeople. Our ships had peculiar
looking masts, masts which the townspeople compared to
the baskets which the French peasants carry on their
backs when they harvest the lettuce. Out further from
the shore were our low-lying torpedo destroyers, pointed
toward the menace of the outer deep.</p>

<p>Busy puffing tugs were warping the first troop ship
toward the quay-side. Some twenty or thirty American
sailors and soldiers, who had been previously landed by
launch to assist in the disembarkation, were handling the
lines on the dock.</p>

<p>When but twenty feet from the quay-side, the successive
decks of the first troop ship took on the appearance
of mud-coloured layers from the khaki uniforms of the
stiff standing ranks of our men. A military band on the
forward deck was playing the national anthems of France
and America and every hand was being held at the salute.</p>

<p>As the final bars of the "Star Spangled Banner"
crashed out and every saluting hand came snappily down,
one American soldier on an upper deck leaned over the
rail and shouted to a comrade on the shore his part of
the first exchange of greetings between our fighting
men upon this historic occasion. Holding one hand to
his lips, he seriously enquired:</p>

<p>"Say, do they let the enlisted men in the saloons
here?"</p>

<span class="caption">THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF FRANCE</span>
</div>

<p>Another soldier standing near the stern rail had a different
and more serious interrogation to make. He appeared
rather blasé about it as he leaned over the rail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and, directing his voice toward a soldier on the dock,
casually demanded:</p>

<p>"Say, where the Hell is all this trouble, anyhow?"</p>

<p>These two opening sorties produced a flood of others.
The most common enquiry was: "What's the name of
this place?" and "Is this France or England?" When
answers were made to these questions, the recipients of
the information, particularly if they happened to be "old-timers
in the army," would respond by remarking, "Well,
it's a damn sight better than the Mexican border."</p>

<p>As our men came over the ship's side and down the
runways, there was no great reception committee awaiting
them. Among the most interested spectators of the
event were a group of stolid German prisoners of war
and the two French soldiers guarding them. The two
Frenchmen talked volubly with a wealth of gesticulation,
while the Germans maintained their characteristic glumness.</p>

<p>The German prisoners appeared to be anything but
discouraged at the sight. Some of them even wore a
smile that approached the supercilious. With some of
them that smile seemed to say: "You can't fool us. We
know these troops are not Americans. They are either
Canadians or Australians coming from England. Our
German U-boats won't let Americans cross the ocean."</p>

<p>Some of those German prisoners happened to have
been in America before the war. They spoke English
and recognised the uniforms of our men. Their silent
smiles seemed to say: "Well, they don't look so good at
that. We have seen better soldiers. And, besides, there
is only a handful of them. Not enough can come to
make any difference. Anyhow, it is too late now. The
war will be over before any appreciable number can get
here."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>But the stream of khaki continued to pour out of the
ship's side. Company after company of our men, loaded
down with packs and full field equipment, lined up on
the dock and marched past the group of German prisoners.</p>

<p>"We're passing in review for you, Fritzie," one irrepressible
from our ranks shouted, as the marching line
passed within touching distance of the prisoner group.
The Germans responded only with quizzical little smiles
and silence.</p>

<p>Escorted by our own military bands, the regiments
marched through the main street of the village. The
bands played "Dixie"&mdash;a new air to France. The regiments
as a whole did not present the snappy, marching
appearance that they might have presented. There was
a good reason for this. Sixty per cent. of them were recruits.
It had been wisely decided to replace many of
the old regular army men in the ranks with newly enlisted
men, so that these old veterans could remain in
America and train the new drafts.</p>

<p>However, that which impressed the French people was
the individual appearance of these samples of American
manhood. Our men were tall and broad and brawny.
They were young and vigorous. Their eyes were keen
and snappy. Their complexions ranged in shade from
the swarthy sun-tanned cheeks of border veterans to the
clear pink skins of city youngsters. But most noticeable
of all to the French people were the even white rows of
teeth which our men displayed when they smiled. Good
dentistry and clean mouths are essentially American.</p>

<p>The villagers of St. Nazaire, old men and women,
girls and school children, lined the curbs as our men
marched through the town. The line of march was over
a broad esplanade that circled the sandy beach of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
bay, and then wound upward into the higher ground
back of the town. The road here was bordered on either
side with ancient stone walls covered with vines and
over the tops of the walls there extended fruit-laden
branches to tempt our men with their ripe, red lusciousness.
As they marched through the heat and dust of
that June day, many succumbed to the temptations and
paid for their appetites with inordinately violent colics
that night.</p>

<p>A camp site had been partially prepared for their reception.
It was located close to a French barracks. The
French soldiers and gangs of German prisoners, who had
been engaged in this work, had no knowledge of the
fact that they were building the first American cantonment
in France. They thought they were constructing
simply an extension of the French encampment.</p>

<p>That first contingent, composed of United States Infantrymen
and Marines, made its first camp in France
with the smallest amount of confusion, considering the
fact that almost three-quarters of them hadn't been in
uniform a month. It was but several hours after arriving
at the camp that the smoke was rising from the
busy camp stoves and the aroma of American coffee,
baked beans and broiled steaks was in the air.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of that first day some of the men
were given permission to visit the town. They began to
take their first lessons in French as they went from café
to café in futile efforts to connect up with such unknown
commodities as cherry pie or ham and egg sandwiches.
Upon meeting one another in the streets, our men would
invariably ask: "Have you come across any of these
<span class="smcap">FROGS</span> that talk American?"</p>

<p>There was nothing disrespectful about the terms Frogs
or Froggies as applied to their French comrades in arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
American officers hastened to explain to French officers
that the one piece of information concerning France most
popularly known in America was that it was the place
where people first learned to eat frog legs and snails.</p>

<p>The Frenchmen, on the other hand, were somewhat
inclined to believe that these first Americans didn't live
up to the European expectations of Americans. Those
European expectations had been founded almost entirely
upon the translations of dime novels and moving picture
thrillers of the Wild West and comedy variety.</p>

<p>Although our men wore the high, broad-brimmed felt
hats, they didn't seem sufficiently cowboyish. Although
the French people waited expectantly, none of these
Americans dashed through the main street of the village
on bucking bronchos, holding their reins in their teeth
and at the same time firing revolvers from either hand.
Moreover, none of our men seemed to conclude their
dinners in the expected American fashion of slapping
one another in the face with custard pies.</p>

<p>There was to be seen on the streets of St. Nazaire that
day some representative black Americans, who had also
landed in that historical first contingent. There was a
strange thing about these negroes.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that in the early stages of our
participation in the war it had been found that there
was hardly sufficient khaki cloth to provide uniforms for
all of our soldiers. That had been the case with these
American negro soldiers.</p>

<p>But somewhere down in Washington, somehow or
other, some one resurrected an old, large, heavy iron key
and this, inserted into an ancient rusty lock, had opened
some long forgotten doors in one of the Government
arsenals. There were revealed old dust-covered bundles
wrapped up in newspapers, yellow with age, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
these wrappings of the past were removed, there were
seen the uniforms of old Union blue that had been laid
away back in '65&mdash;uniforms that had been worn by men
who fought and bled and died to free the first black
American citizens.</p>

<p>And here on this foreign shore, on this day in June
more than half a century later, the sons and the grandsons
of those same freed slaves wore those same uniforms
of Union blue as they landed in France to fight
for a newer freedom.</p>

<p>Some of these negroes were stevedores from the lower
Mississippi levees. They sang as they worked in their
white army undershirts, across the chest of which they
had penciled in blue and red, strange mystic devices, religious
phrases and hoodoo signs, calculated to contribute
the charm of safety to the running of the submarine
blockade.</p>

<p>Two of these American negroes, walking up the main
street of St. Nazaire, saw on the other side of the thoroughfare
a brother of colour wearing the lighter blue
uniform of a French soldier. This French negro was
a Colonial black from the north of Africa and of course
had spoken nothing but French from the day he was born.</p>

<p>One of the American negroes crossed the street and
accosted him.</p>

<p>"Looka here, boy," he enquired good-naturedly, "what
can you all tell me about this here wah?"</p>

<p>"Comment, monsieur?" responded the non-understanding
French black, and followed the rejoinder with a torrent
of excited French.</p>

<p>The American negro's mouth fell open. For a minute
he looked startled, and then he bulged one large round
white eye suspiciously at the French black, while he inwardly
debated on the possibility that he had become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
suddenly colour blind. Having reassured himself, however,
that his vision was not at fault, he made a sudden
decision and started on a new tack.</p>

<p>"Now, never mind that high-faluting language," he
said. "You all just tell me what you know about this
here wah and quit you' putting on aihs."</p>

<p>The puzzled French negro could only reply with another
explosion of French interrogations, coupled with
vigorous gesticulations. The American negro tried to
talk at the same time and both of them endeavouring
to make the other understand, increased the volumes of
their tones until they were standing there waving their
arms and shouting into one another's faces. The American
negro gave it up.</p>

<p>"My Gawd," he said, shaking his head as he recrossed
the street and joined his comrades, "this is shore some
funny country. They got the mos' ignorantest niggers
I ever saw."</p>

<p>Still, those American blacks were not alone in their
difficulties over the difference in languages. I discussed
the matter with one of our white regulars who professed
great experience, having spent almost one entire day on
mutual guard with a French sentry over a pile of baggage.</p>

<p>"You know," he said, "I don't believe these Frenchies
ever will learn to speak English."</p>

<p>Our veterans from Mexico and the border campaigns
found that their smattering of Spanish did not help them
much. But still every one seemed to manage to get along
all right. Our soldiers and the French soldiers in those
early days couldn't understand each other's languages,
but they could understand each other.</p>

<p>This strange paradox was analysed for me by a young
American Lieutenant who said he had made a twelve-hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
study of the remarkable camaraderie that had immediately
sprung up between the fighting men of France
and the fighting men of America. In explaining this relationship,
he said:</p>

<p>"You see, we think the French are crazy," he said,
"and the French know damn well we are."</p>

<p>Those of our men who had not brought small French
and English dictionaries with them, made hurried purchases
of such handy articles and forthwith began to
practice. The French people did likewise.</p>

<p>I saw one young American infantryman seated at a
table in front of one of the sidewalk cafés on the village
square. He was dividing his attention between a fervent
admiration of the pretty French waitress, who stood
smiling in front of him, and an intense interest in the
pages of his small hand dictionary.</p>

<p>She had brought his glass of beer and he had paid for
it, but there seemed to be a mutual urge for further conversation.
The American would look first at her and
then he would look through the pages of the book again.
Finally he gave slow and painful enunciation of the following
request:</p>

<p>"Mad-am-moy-sell, donnie moy oon baysa."</p>

<p>She laughed prettily as she caught his meaning almost
immediately, and she replied:</p>

<p>"Doughboy, ware do you get zat stuff?"</p>

<p>"Aw, Hell," said the young Infantryman, as he closed
the book with a snap. "I knew they'd let those sailors
ashore before us."</p>

<p>From the very first day of the landing we began to
learn things from the French and they began to learn
things from us. Some of our men learned that it was
quite possible to sip an occasional glass of beer or light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
wine without feeling a sudden inclination to buy and
consume all there remained in the café.</p>

<p>The French soldiers were intensely interested in the
equipment of our land forces and in the uniforms of
both our soldiers and sailors. They sought by questions
to get an understanding of the various insignia by which
the Americans designated their rank.</p>

<p>One thing that they noticed was a small, round white
pasteboard tag suspended on a yellow cord from the
upper left hand breast pocket of either the blue jackets
of our sailors or the khaki shirts of our soldiers. So
prevalent was this tag, which in reality marked the
wearer as the owner of a package of popular tobacco,
that the French almost accepted it as uniform equipment.</p>

<p>The attitude of our first arriving American soldiers
toward the German prisoners who worked in gangs on
construction work in the camps and rough labour along
the docks was a curious one. Not having yet encountered
in battle the brothers of these same docile appearing
captives, our men were even inclined to treat the
prisoners with deference almost approaching admiration.</p>

<p>In a measure, the Germans returned this feeling. The
arrival of the Americans was really cheering to them.
The prisoners disliked the French because they had been
taught to do so from childhood. They hated the English
because that was the hate with which they went into
battle.</p>

<p>It sounds incongruous now but, nevertheless, it was
a fact then that the German prisoners confined at that first
American sea-base really seemed to like the American
soldiers. Maybe it was because any change of masters
or guards was a relief in the uneventful existence which
had been theirs since the day of their capture. Perhaps
the feeling was one of distinct kindred, based on a familiarity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
with Americans and American customs&mdash;a familiarity
which had been produced by thousands of letters
which Germans in America had written to their
friends in Germany before the war. On the other hand,
it may simply have been by reason of America's official
disavowal of any animosity toward the German people.</p>

<p>One day I watched some of those prisoners unloading
supplies at one of the docks in St. Nazaire, more or less
under the eyes of an American sentry who stood nearby.
One group of four Germans were engaged in carrying
what appeared to be a large wooden packing case. Casually,
and as if by accident, the case was dropped to the
ground and cracked.</p>

<p>Instantly one of the prisoners' hands began to furtively
investigate the packages revealed by the break.
The other prisoners busied themselves as if preparing to
lift the box again. The first German pulled a spoon from
his bootleg, plunged it into the crevice in the broken box
and withdrew it heaped with granulated sugar. With
a quick movement he conveyed the stolen sweet to his
mouth and that gapping orifice closed quickly on the
sugar, while his stoical face immediately assumed its
characteristic downcast look. He didn't dare move his
lips or jaws for fear of detection.</p>

<p>Of course these Germans had been receiving but a
scant ration of sugar, but their lot had been no worse
than that of the French soldiers guarding them previously,
who got no sugar either. American soldiers
then guarding those prisoners reported only a few of
them for confinement for these human thefts.</p>

<p>Surreptitiously, the American guards would sometimes
leave cigarettes where the prisoners could get them, and
even though the action did violate the rules of discipline,
it helped to develop further the human side of the giver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and the recipient and at the same time had the result of
making the prisoners do more work for their new
guards.</p>

<p>It should be specially stated that lenience could not
and was not extended to the point of fraternisation. But
the relationship that seemed to exist between the German
prisoners and American soldiers at that early date
revealed undeniably the absence of any mutual hate.</p>

<p>Around one packing case on the dock I saw, one day,
a number of German prisoners who were engaged in unpacking
bundles from America, and passing them down
a line of waiting hands that relayed them to a freight car.
One of the Germans leaning over the case straightened
up with a rumpled newspaper in his hand. He had removed
it from a package. A look of indescribable joy
came across his face.</p>

<p>"Deutscher, Deutscher," he cried, pointing to the
Gothic type. The paper was a copy of the New York
<i>Staats-Zeitung</i>.</p>

<p>The lot of those prisoners was not an unhappy one.
To me it seemed very doubtful whether even a small
percentage of them would have accepted liberty if it
carried with it the necessity of returning to German
trenches.</p>

<p>Those men knew what war was. They had crossed
No Man's Land. Now they were far back from the
blazing front in a comparatively peaceful country beyond
the sound of the guns. If their lot at that time was
to be characterised as "war," then in the opinion of
those Germans, war was not what Sherman said it was.</p>

<p>Their attitude more resembled that of the unkissed
spinster who was taken captive when the invading army
captured the town. She flung herself into the arms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the surprised commander of the invaders and smilingly
whispered, "War is war."</p>

<p>The German prison camps at St. Nazaire were inspected
by General Pershing on the third day of the
American landing when he, with his staff, arrived from
Paris. The General and his party arrived early in the
morning in a pouring rain. The American commander-in-chief
then held the rank of a Major General. In the
harbour was the flagship of Rear Admiral Gleaves.</p>

<p>There was no delay over the niceties of etiquette when
the question arose as to whether the Rear Admiral should
call on the Major General or the Major General should
call on the Rear Admiral.</p>

<p>The Major General settled the subject with a sentence.
He said, "The point is that I want to see him," and with
no further ado about it General Pershing and his staff
visited the Admiral on his flagship. After his inspection
of our first contingent, General Pershing said:</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p>"This is the happiest day of the busy days which I
have spent in France preparing for the arrival of the
first contingent. To-day I have seen our troops safe on
French soil, landing from transports that were guarded
in their passage overseas by the resourceful vigilance of
our Navy.</p>

<p>"Now, our task as soldiers lies before us. We hope,
with the aid of the French leaders and experts who have
placed all the results of their experience at our disposal,
to make our forces worthy in skill and in determination,
to fight side by side in arms with the armies of France."</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THROUGH THE SCHOOL OF WAR</h3>


<p>Clip the skyline from the Blue Ridge, arch it over with
arboreal vistas from the forests of the Oregon, reflect
the two in the placid waters of the Wisconsin&mdash;and you
will have some conception of the perfect Eden of beauty
in which the first contingent of the American Expeditionary
Forces trained in France.</p>

<p>Beckoning white roads curl through the rolling hills
like ribbons of dental cream squeezed out evenly on rich
green velour. Châteaux, pearl white centres in settings
of emerald green, push their turrets and bastions above
the mossy plush of the mountain side. Lazy little
streams silver the valleys with their aimless wanderings.</p>

<p>It was a peaceful looking garden of pastoral delight
that United States soldiers had picked out for their martial
training ground. It was a section whose physical
appearance was untouched by the three years of red riot
and roar that still rumbled away just a few miles to the
north.</p>

<p>The training area was located in the Vosges, in east
central France. By train, it was a nine-hour day trip
from Paris. It was located about an hour's motor ride
behind the front lines, which at that time were close to
the north of the cities of Nancy and Toul.</p>

<p>The troops were billeted in a string of small villages
that comprised one side of the letter V. French troops
and instructing officers occupied the other converging
line of the letter. Between the two lines was the area in
which our men trained. Where the two lines converged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
was the town of Gondercourt, the headquarters of Major
General Seibert, the Commander of the first American
division in France.</p>

<p>The area had long since been stripped of male civilian
population that could be utilised for the French ranks.
The war had taken the men and the boys, but had left
the old people and children to till the fields, tend the
cattle, prune the hedges and trim the roads.</p>

<p>With the advent of our troops, the restful scene began
to change. Treeless ridges carpeted with just enough
green to veil the rocky formation of the ground began to
break out with a superficial rash of the colour of fresh
earth. In rows and circles, by angles and zigzags, the
training trenches began to take form daily under the pick
and shovel exercises of French and Americans working
side by side.</p>

<p>Along the white roads, clay-coloured rectangles that
moved evenly, like brown caravans, represented the
marching units of United States troops. The columns
of bluish-grey that passed them with shorter, quicker
steps, were companies of those tireless Frenchmen, who
after almost three years of the front line real thing, now
played at a mimic war of make-believe, with taller and
heavier novitiates.</p>

<p>Those French troops were Alpine Chasseurs&mdash;the famous
Blue Devils. They wore dark blue caps, which
resemble tam o'shanters, but are not. They were proud
of the distinction which their uniform gave them. They
were proud of their great fighting records. One single
battalion of them boasted that of the twenty-six officers
who led it into the first fight at the opening of the war,
only four of them existed.</p>

<p>It was a great advantage for our men to train under
such instructors. Correspondents who had been along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the fronts before America's entry into the war, had a
great respect for the soldierly capacity of these same fighting
Frenchmen; not only these sturdy young sons of
France who wore the uniform, but the older French soldiers&mdash;ranging
in age from forty to fifty-five years&mdash;who
had been away to the fronts since the very beginning
of the war.</p>

<p>We had seen them many, many times. Miles upon
miles of them, in the motor trucks along the roads.
Twenty of them rode in each truck. They sat on two
side benches facing the centre of the trucks. They were
men actually bent forward from the weight of the martial
equipment strapped to their bodies. They seemed to
carry inordinate loads&mdash;knapsacks, blanket roll, spare
shoes, haversacks, gas masks, water bottles, ammunition
belts, grenade aprons, rifle, bayonet and helmet.</p>

<p>Many of them were very old men. They had thick
black eyebrows and wore long black beards. They were
tired, weary men. We had seen them in the camions,
each man resting his head on the shoulder of the man
seated beside him. The dust of the journey turned their
black beards grey. On the front seat of the camion a
sleepless one handled the wheel, while beside him the
relief driver slept on the seat.</p>

<p>Thus they had been seen, mile upon mile of them,
thousand upon thousand of them, moving ever up and
down those roads that paralleled the six hundred and
fifty miles of front from Flanders to the Alps&mdash;moving
always. Thus they had been seen night and day, winter
and summer, for more than three long years, always
trying to be at the place where the enemy struck. The
world knows and the world is thankful that they always
were there.</p>

<p>It was under such veteran instructors as these that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
our first Americans in France trained, there, in the
Vosges, in a garden spot of beauty, in the province that
boasts the birthplace of Jeanne d'Arc. On the few leave
days, many of our men, with permission, would absent
themselves from camp, and make short pilgrimages over
the hills to the little town of Domremy to visit the house
in which the Maid of Orleans was born.</p>

<p>Our men were eager to learn. I observed them daily
at their training tasks. One day when they had progressed
as far as the use of the New French automatic
rifles, I visited one of the ranges to witness the firing.</p>

<p>Just under the crest of the hill was a row of rifle pits,
four feet deep in the slaty white rock. On the opposite
hill, across the marshy hollow, at a distance of two hundred
yards, was a line of wooden targets, painted white
with black circles. Poised at intervals on the forward
edge of the pits were a number of automatic rifles of the
type used by the French army. An American soldier
and a French soldier attended each one, the former in
the firing position and the latter instructing.</p>

<p>The rear bank of the pits was lined with French and
American officers. The order, "Commence firing," was
given, and white spurts of rock dust began dancing on
the opposite hill, while splinters began to fly from some
of the wooden targets.</p>

<p>At one end of the firing trench a raw American recruit,
who admitted that he had never handled an automatic
rifle before, flushed to his hat-brim and gritted his
teeth viciously as his shots, registering ten feet above
the targets, brought forth laughter and exclamations
from the French soldiers nearby. He rested on his gun
long enough to ask an interpreter what the Frenchmen
were talking about.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"They say," the interpreter replied, "that you belong
to the anti-aircraft service."</p>

<p>The recruit tightened his grip on his rifle and lowered
his aim with better results. At the end of his first fifty
shots he was placing one in three on the target and the
others were registering close in.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" came from a group of French officers at the
other end of the trench, where another American, older
in the service, had signalised his first experiences with the
new firearm by landing thirty targets out of thirty-four
shots, and four of the targets were bull's-eyes. The
French instructors complimented him on the excellence
of his marksmanship, considering his acknowledged unfamiliarity
with the weapon.</p>

<p>Further along the depression, in another set of opposing
trenches and targets, a row of French machine
guns manned by young Americans, sprayed lead with
ear-splitting abandon, sometimes reaching the rate of five
hundred shots a minute. Even with such rapidity, the
Americans encountered no difficulties with the new pieces.</p>

<p>French veterans, who for three years had been using
those same guns against German targets, hovered over
each piece, explaining in half French and half English,
and answering in the same mixture questions on ways
and means of getting the best results from the weapons.</p>

<p>Here a chasseur of the ranks would stop the firing of
one American squad, with a peremptory, "Regardez."
He would proceed with pantomime and more or less connected
words, carrying the warning that firing in such a
manner would result in jamming the guns, a condition
which would be fatal in case the targets in the other
trenches were charging upon the guns.</p>

<p>Then he showed the correct procedure, and the Yanks,
watchfully alert to his every move, changed their method<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and signified their pleasure with the expression of "Trays
beans," and "Mercy's."</p>

<p>"Do you think it would have resulted in a quicker and
possibly more understanding training if these Americans
were instructed by British veterans instead of French?"
I asked an American Staff Officer, who was observing
the demonstration.</p>

<p>"I may have thought so at first," the officer replied,
"but not now. The explanations which our men in the
ranks are receiving from the French soldiers in the ranks
are more than word instructions. They are object lessons
in which gesticulation and pantomime are used to
act out the movement or subject under discussion.</p>

<p>"The French are great actors, and I find that American
soldiers unacquainted with the French language are
able to understand the French soldiers who are unacquainted
with the English language much better than
the American officers, similarly handicapped, can understand
the French officers.</p>

<p>"I should say that some time would be lost if all of
our troops were to be trained by French soldiers, but I
believe that this division under French tutelage will be
better able to teach the new tactics to the new divisions
that are to follow than it would be if it had speedily
passed through training camps like the British system,
for instance, where it must be taken for granted that
verbal, instead of actual, instruction is the means of producing
a speeding up of training."</p>

<p>Thus it was that our first American contingent in
France was in training for something more than service
on the line. It rapidly qualified into an expert corps
from which large numbers of capable American instructors
were later withdrawn and used for the training
of our millions of men that followed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>This achievement was only accomplished by the exercise
of strict disciplinarian measures by every American
officer in the then small expedition. One day, in the early
part of August, 1917, a whirlwind swept through the
string of French villages where the first contingent was
training.</p>

<p>The whirlwind came down the main road in a cloud of
dust. It sped on the fleeting tires of a high-powered
motor which flew from its dust-grey hood a red flag
with two white stars. It blew into the villages and out,
through the billets and cook tents, mess halls, and picket
lines. The whirlwind was John J. Pershing.</p>

<p>The commander-in-chief "hit" the training area early
in the morning and his coming was unannounced. Before
evening he had completed a stern inspection which
had left only one impression in the minds of the inspected,
and that impression was to the effect that more
snap and pep, more sharpness and keenness were needed.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the inspection all of the officers
of the contingent were agreeing that the whirlwind visitation
was just what had been needed to arouse the mettle
and spirit in an organisation comprised of over fifty per
cent. raw recruits. Many of the officers themselves had
been included in the pointed criticisms which the commander
directed against the persons and things that met
disfavour in his eyes.</p>

<p>The night following that inspection or "raid," as it
was called, it would have been safe to say that nowhere
in the area was there a recruit who did not know, in a
manner that he would not forget, the correct position of
a soldier&mdash;the precise, stiff, snappy attitude to be presented
when called to attention. The enlisted men whose
heels did not click when they met, whose shoulders
slouched, whose chins missed the proper angle, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
eyes were not "front" during the inspection, underwent
embarrassing penalties, calculated to make them remember.</p>

<p>"Have this man fall out," General Pershing directed,
as he stood before a recruit whose attitude appeared
sloppy; "teach him the position of a soldier and have
him stand at attention for five minutes."</p>

<p>One company which had prided itself upon having
some of the best embryonic bomb-throwers in the contingent,
contributed a number of victims to the above
penalties, and as the General's train of automobiles
swirled out of the village, the main street seemed to be
dotted with silent khaki-clad statues doing their five minute
sentences of rigidity.</p>

<p>"What about your men's shoes?" General Pershing
asked a captain sharply, while he directed his eyes along
a company line of feet whose casings seemed to be approaching
the shabby.</p>

<p>"We need hobnails, sir," replied the captain.</p>

<p>"Get them"&mdash;the words snapped out from beneath
Pershing's close-cropped grey moustache. "Requisition
hobnails. Your men need them. Get them from the
quartermaster."</p>

<p>The American commander stepped into the darkness
of a large stone-walled stable, which represented the
billeting accommodations for ten American soldiers. A
dog curled in the doorway growled and showed its teeth.
The General stepped past the menacing animal, and without
heeding its snarls close to his heels, started questioning
the sergeants in charge.</p>

<p>"Are any cattle kept in here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Detail more men with brooms and have it aired thoroughly
every day."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Observed from a distance, when he was speaking with
battalion and regimental commanders, the commander
manifested no change of attitude from that which marked
his whole inspection. He frequently employed his characteristic
gesture of emphasis&mdash;the wadding of his left
palm with his right fist or the energetic opening and
closing of the right hand. When the Pershing whirlwind
sped out of the training area that night, after the first
American inspection in France, it left behind it a thorough
realisation of the sternness of the work which was
ahead of our army.</p>

<p>The development of a rigid discipline was the American
commander's first objective in the training schedules
which he ordered his staff to devise. After this schedule
had been in operation not ten days, I happened to witness
a demonstration of American discipline which might be
compared to an improved incident of Damocles dining
under the suspended sword at the feast of Dionysius.</p>

<p>A battalion of American Infantry was at practice on
one of the training fields. The grenade-throwing exercises
had been concluded and the order had been given to
"fall in" preparatory to the march back to the camp.</p>

<p>Upon the formation of the long company lines, end
on end down the side of the hill, the order, "attention,"
was sharply shouted bringing the men to the rigid pose
which permits the eyes to wander neither to the right nor
to the left, above nor below, but straightforward.</p>

<p>As the thousand men stood there, rigid and silent, a
sudden disturbance took place in the sky above them.
Shells began exploding up there. At the same time the
men in the ranks could distinctly hear the whirr and the
hum of aeroplane motors above them.</p>

<p>Almost every day reports had been received that German
planes had evaded the Allied aerial patrols along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the front and had made long flights behind our lines for
the dual purposes of observing and bombing.</p>

<p>As the American battalion stood stiff and motionless,
I knew that the thought was passing through the minds
of every man there that here, at last, was the expected
visitation of the German flyers and that a terrific bomb
from above would be the next event on the programme.
The men recognised the reports of the anti-aircraft guns
blazing away, and the sound of the motors suggested a
close range target.</p>

<p>The sound seemed to indicate that the planes were
flying low. The American ranks knew that something
was going on immediately above them. They did not
know what it was, but it seems needless to state that they
wanted to know. Still the ranks stood as stiff as rows
of clay-coloured statues.</p>

<p>An almost irresistible impulse to look upward, a strong
instinctive urging to see the danger that impended, and
the stern regulations of "eyes front" that goes with the
command "attention," comprised the elements of conflict
that went on in each of the thousand heads in that
battalion line.</p>

<p>In front of each platoon, the lieutenants and captains
stood with the same rigid eyes front facing the men. If
one of the company officers had relaxed to the extent
of taking one fleeting upward glance, it is doubtful
whether the men could have further resisted the same
inclination, but not a man shifted his gaze from the
direction prescribed by the last command.</p>

<p>One plane passed closely overhead and nothing happened.
Three more followed and still no bombs fell, and
then the tense incident was closed by the calling out of
the order of the march and, in squads of four, the battalion
wheeled into the road and marched back to billets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>As one company went by singing (talking was permitted
upon the freedom of routstep), I heard one of
the men say that he had thought all along that the officers
would not have made them stand there at attention if
the danger had not been over.</p>

<p>"As far as I knew, it was over," a comrade added.
"It was right over my head." And in this light manner
the men forgot the incident as they resumed their
marching song.</p>

<p>When Mr. W. Hollenzollern of Potsdam put singing
lessons in the curriculum of his soldiers' training, a
tremor of military giggling was heard around the world.
But in August, 1914, when Mars smiled at the sight of
those same soldiers, marching across the frontiers east,
south and west, under their throaty barrage of "Deutschland,
Deutschland, Über Alles," the derisive giggles completely
died out. It immediately became a case of he
who laughs first, lives to yodel.</p>

<p>The American forces then in training took advantage
of this. They not only began to sing as they trained,
but they actually began to be trained to sing. Numerous
company commanders who had held strong opinions
against this vocal soldiering, changed their minds and
expressed the new found conviction that the day was
past when singing armies could be compared solely with
male coryphées who hold positions well down stage and
clink empty flagons of brown October ale.</p>

<p>"It's a great idea," a company commander told me.
"We learned it from the Blue Devils. They are the
toughest set of undersized gentry that I have run into
in France. They have forearms as big as three-inch
shells, and as hard. Their favourite pastime is juggling
hand-grenades that can't possibly explode unless they
just lightly touch one another.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yesterday we watched them, bared to the waist, as
they went through three hours of grenade and bombing
practice that was the last word in strenuosity. Keeping
up with their exercises was hard work for our men,
whose arms soon began to ache from the unaccustomed,
overhand heaving.</p>

<p>"Then we watched them as their commander assembled
them for the march back to the village. At the command,
'attention,' their heels clicked, their heads went
back, their chins up and their right hands were pasted
rigidly against their right trouser leg.</p>

<p>"At the command 'march' all of them started off,
punctuating their first step with the first word of their
marching song. It was not any sickly chorus either.
There was plenty of beef and lung power behind every
note. My men lined up opposite were not missing a bit
of it. Most of them seemed to know what was expected
when I said:</p>

<p>"'On the command of "march," the company will begin
to sing, keeping step with the song. The first sergeant
will announce the song.'</p>

<p>"My first sergeant responded without a change of
colour as if the command to sing had been an old regulation.
I knew that he was puzzled, but he did it well.
The name of the song chosen was passed down the line
from man to man.</p>

<p>"When I gave the command to march, the company,
almost half of them new recruits, wheeled in squads of
fours, and started off down the road singing, 'Hail, Hail,
the Gang's All Here.' There were some who were kind
of weak on the effort, but there was a noticeable crescendo
when the sergeant passed the word down the squad
that the company would be kept marching until everybody
had joined in the singing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"We swung into camp that night with every voice
raising lustily on 'One Grasshopper Hopped Right Over
Another Grasshopper's Back,' and after dinner the billets
just sprouted melody, everything from ragtime to Christmas
carols and baby lullabies."</p>

<p>One noticeable characteristic about our soldiers during
that training period before they had come in contact with
the enemy, was a total absence of violent antipathy toward
all persons and things Teutonic.</p>

<p>On the march the men then sang "We'll Hang the
Damned Old Kaiser to a Sour Apple Tree," but at that
time I never heard any parodies on the "Gott Straffe
Germany" theme. Our soldiers were of so many different
nationalistic extractions and they had been thrown
together for so short a time, that as yet no especial hatred
of the enemy had developed.</p>

<p>An illustration of this very subject and also the manner
in which our boys got along with the civilian populations
of the towns they occupied came to my notice.</p>

<p>A driving rain which filled the valley with mist and
made the hills look like mountain tops projecting above
the clouds, had resulted in the abandonment of the usual
daily drills. The men had spent the day in billets writing
letters home, hearing indoor lectures from instructors,
playing with the French children in the cottage doorways,
or taking lessons in French from the peasant girls,
whose eyes were inspirations to the dullest pupils.</p>

<p>I spent several hours in a company commander's quarters
while he censored letters which the men had submitted
for transmission back home. The Captain looked
long at a letter in his hand, smiled and called for his
orderly.</p>

<p>"Tell Private Blank I want to see him here right
away," were the Captain's instructions. Blank's name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
was not quite so German as Sourkraut, but it had a
"berger" ending that was reminiscent of beer, pretzels
and wooden shoes.</p>

<p>"Here's a letter written in German," said the Captain
to me, referring to the open missive. "It's addressed to
somebody by the same name as Blank, and I presume
it is to some one in his family. Blank is one of the
best men in my company, and I know that the letter is
harmless, but it is impossible for me to pass it when
written in an enemy language."</p>

<p>The door opened and a tall, blonde enlisted man
stepped in, shaking the rain from his hat. He stood at
respectful attention, saluted and said:</p>

<p>"Did the Captain wish to see me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Blank, it is about this letter written in German,"
the Captain replied. "Who is it addressed to?"</p>

<p>"My father, in Cincinnati, sir," Blank replied.</p>

<p>"I am unfamiliar with German," the Captain said. "I
notice the letter is brief. Is there anything in it which
the company has been ordered to omit mentioning?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," Blank replied.</p>

<p>"Will you translate it for me?" the Captain asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Blank, with just a bare suggestion of a
blush. Then he read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"Dear Father: I am in good health. Food is good
and we are learning much. I am becoming an expert
grenadier. In this village where we are billeted there
is a French girl named Germain. Before the war she
lived in northern France, near the German frontier, and
she speaks German. So it is possible for us to talk
together. She fled before the German troops reached
her village. She lives here now with her aunt.</p>

<p>"I carry water from a well for her and she has given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
me each day a roll of fresh made butter for our mess.
In the evening we sit on the front seat of her uncle's
small carriage, which is in the front yard, and we imagine
we are taking a drive, but of course there are no horses.
Her uncle's horses were taken by the army a long time
ago. She is very anxious to know all about America,
and I have told her all about you and mother and our
home in Cincinnati.</p>

<p>"She asked me what I am going to do after the war,
and I told her that I would return to Cincinnati to help
you at the store. She cried because she said she did not
know where she was going after the war. Her father
and two brothers have been killed and her aunt and
uncle are very old.</p>

<p>"I have some more to write to you about Germain
later. But must stop here because the Sergeants are assembling
the men for indoor instruction. Love to all.
It is raining very hard. Your son, &mdash;&mdash;"</p></div>

<p>Blank's face seemed to redden as he hesitated over a
postscript line at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>"This is nothing," he said. "I just asked father to
ask mother to send me one of the photographs I had
taken on the day I enlisted."</p>

<p>"For Germain?" the Captain enquired, smilingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Blank.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you write this in English?" the Captain
asked.</p>

<p>"My father reads only German," Blank replied.</p>

<p>Blank was instructed to rewrite his letter in English
and address it to some friend who could translate it into
German for his father. As the door closed on this
American soldier of German extraction, I asked the Captain,
"Do you think Germain could stand for Blank's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
German name, after all she has lost at the hands of the
Germans?"</p>

<p>"She'll probably be wearing it proudly around Cincinnati
within a year after the war is over," the Captain
replied.</p>

<p>It might be reassuring at this point to remark that
girls in America really have no occasion to fear that
many of our soldiers will leave their hearts in France.
The French women are kind to them, help them in their
French lessons, and frequently feed them with home
delicacies unknown to the company mess stoves, but
every American soldier overseas seems to have that perfectly
natural hankering to come back to the girls he
left behind.</p>

<p>The soldier mail addressed daily to mothers and sweethearts
back in the States ran far into the tons. The
men were really homesick for their American women
folks. I was aware of this even before I witnessed the
reception given by our men to the first American nurses
to reach the other side.</p>

<p>The hospital unit to which they belonged had been
transported into that training area so quickly and so
secretly that its presence there was unknown for some
time. I happened to locate it by chance.</p>

<p>Several of us correspondents seeking a change of diet
from the monotonous menu provided by the hard-working
madam of our modest hostelry, motored in a new direction,
over roads that opened new vistas in this picture
book of the world.</p>

<p>Long straight avenues of towering trees whose foliage
roofed the roadways were sufficient to reanimate recollections
of old masters of brush realism. Ploughed fields
veiled with the low-hanging mist of evening time, and
distant steeples of homely simplicity faintly glazed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the last rays of the setting sun, reproduced the tones of
"The Angelus" with the over-generous hugeness of nature.</p>

<p>And there in that prettiest of French watering places&mdash;Vittel&mdash;we
came upon those first American nurses attached
to the American Expeditionary Forces. They
told us that all they knew was the name of the place
they were in, that they were without maps and were
not even aware of what part of France they were located
in.</p>

<p>It developed that the unit's motor transportation had
not arrived and, other automobiles being as scarce as
German flags, communication with the nearby camps had
been almost non-existent. Orders had been received
from field headquarters and acknowledged, but its relation
in distance or direction to their whereabouts were
shrouded in mystery. But not for long.</p>

<p>Soon the word spread through the training area that
American nurses had a hospital in the same zone and
some of the homesick Yanks began to make threats of
self-mutilation in order that they might be sent to that
hospital.</p>

<p>The hospital unit was soon followed by the arrival of
numerous American auxiliary organisations and the
kindly activities of the workers as well as their numbers
became such as to cause the men to wonder what kind
of a war they were in.</p>

<p>I happened to meet an old top sergeant of the regular
army, a man I had known in Mexico, with the American
Punitive Expedition. He had just received a large bundle
of newspapers from home and he was bringing himself
up-to-date on the news. I asked him what was
happening back home.</p>

<p>"Great things are going on in the States," he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
looking up from his papers. "Here's one story in the
newspaper that says the Y. M. C. A. is sending over five
hundred secretaries to tell us jokes and funny stories.
And here's another account about the Red Cross donating
half a million dollars to build recreation booths for us
along the front. And here's a story about a New York
actor getting a committee of entertainers together to
come over and sing and dance for us. And down in
Philadelphia they're talking about collecting a million
dollars to build tabernacles along the front so's Billy
Sunday can preach to us. What I'm wondering about
is, when in hell they're going to send the army over."</p>

<p>But that was in the early fall of 1917, and as I write
these lines now, in the last days of 1918, I am aware
and so is the world, that in all of France nobody will
ever ask that question again.</p>

<p>That army got there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>MAKING THE MEN WHO MAN THE GUNS</h3>


<p>While our infantry perfected their training in the
Vosges, the first American artillery in France undertook
a schedule of studies in an old French artillery post located
near the Swiss frontier. This place is called Valdahon,
and for scores of years had been one of the training
places for French artillery. But during the third
and fourth years of the war nearly all of the French artillery
units being on the front, all subsequent drafts of
French artillerymen received their training under actual
war conditions.</p>

<p>So it was that the French war department turned over
to the Americans this artillery training ground which
had been long vacant. Three American artillery regiments,
the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh, comprising the first
U. S. Artillery Brigade, began training at this post.</p>

<p>The barracks had been long unoccupied and much
preparatory work was necessary before our artillerymen
could move in. Much of this work devolved upon the
shoulders of the Brigade Quartermaster.</p>

<p>The first difficulty that he encountered was the matter
of illumination for the barracks, mess halls and
lecture rooms. All of the buildings were wired, but
there was no current. The Quartermaster began an investigation
and this was what he found:</p>

<p>The post had been supplied with electricity from a
generating plant located on a river about ten miles away.
This plant had supplied electrical energy for fifteen
small French towns located in the vicinity. The plant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
was owned and operated by a Frenchman, who was
about forty years old. The French Government, realising
the necessity for illumination, had exempted this
man from military service, so that he remained at his
plant and kept the same in operation for the benefit of
the camp at Valdahon and the fifteen small towns nearby.</p>

<p>Then the gossips of the countryside got busy. These
people began to say that Monsieur X, the operator of the
plant, was not patriotic, in other words, that he was a
slacker for not being at the front when all of their
menfolk had been sent away to the war.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that Monsieur X was not a
slacker, and his inclination had always been to get into
the fight with the Germans, but the Government had represented
to him that it was his greater duty to remain
and keep his plant in operation to provide light for the
countryside.</p>

<p>When the talk of the countryside reached Monsieur
X's ears, he being a country-loving Frenchman was infuriated.
He denounced the gossips as being unappreciative
of the great sacrifice he had been making for their
benefit, and, to make them realise it, he decided on penalising
them.</p>

<p>Monsieur X simply closed down his plant, locked and
barred the doors and windows, donned his French uniform
and went away to the front to join his old regiment.
That night those villagers in the fifteen nearby
towns, who had been using electrical illumination, went
to bed in the dark.</p>

<p>It required considerable research on the part of the
Artillery Quartermaster to reveal all these facts. The
electric lights had been unused for fifteen months when
he arrived there, and he started to see what he could
do to put the plant back to work. It required nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
less finally than a special action by the French Minister
of War whereby orders were received by Monsieur X
commanding him to leave his regiment at the front and
go back to his plant by the riverside and start making
electricity again.</p>

<p>With the lights on and water piped in for bathing
facilities, and extensive arrangements made for the instalment
of stoves and other heating apparatus, the purchase
of wood fuel and fodder for the animals, the
Brigade moved in and occupied the camp.</p>

<p>The American officer in command of that post went
there as a Brigadier General. As I observed him at his
work in those early days, I seemed to see in his appearance
and disposition some of the characteristics of a
Grant. He wore a stubby-pointed beard and he clamped
his teeth tight on the butt end of a cigar. I saw him
frequently wearing the $11.50 regulation issue uniform
of the enlisted men. I saw him frequently in rubber
boots standing hip deep in the mud of the gun pits,
talking to the men like a father&mdash;a kindly, yet stern
father who knew how to produce discipline and results.</p>

<p>While at the post, he won promotion to a Major
General's rank, and in less than six months he was elevated
to the grade of a full General and was given the
highest ranking military post in the United States. That
man who trained our first artillerymen in France was
General Peyton C. March, Chief of Staff of the United
States Army.</p>

<p>Finding the right man for the right place was one of
General March's hobbies. He believed in military mobilisation
based on occupational qualifications. In other
words, he believed that a man who had been a telephone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
operator in civilian life would make a better telephone
operator in the army than he would make a gunner.</p>

<p>I was not surprised to find that this same worthy idea
had permeated in a more or less similar form down to
the lowest ranks in General March's command at that
time. I encountered it one cold night in October, when
I was sitting in one of the barrack rooms talking with
a man in the ranks.</p>

<p>That man's name was Budd English. I met him
first in Mexico on the American Punitive Expedition,
where he had driven an automobile for Damon Runyon,
a fellow correspondent. English, with his quaint Southwestern
wit, had become in Mexico a welcome occupant
of the large pyramidal tent which housed the correspondents
attached to the Expedition. We would sit for
hours hearing him tell his stories of the plains and the
deserts of Chihuahua.</p>

<p>English and I were sitting on his bed at one corner
of the barrack room, rows of cots ranged each side of
the wall and on these were the snoring men of the battery.
The room was dimly illuminated by a candle on
a shelf over English's head and another candle located
on another shelf in the opposite corner of the room.
There was a man in bed in a corner reading a newspaper
by the feeble rays of the candle.</p>

<p>Suddenly we heard him growl and tear the page of
the newspaper in half. His exclamation attracted my
attention and I looked his way. His hair was closely
cropped and his head, particularly his ears and forehead,
and jaw, stamped him as a rough and ready fighter.</p>

<p>"That's Kid Ferguson, the pug," English whispered
to me, and then in louder tones, he enquired, "What's
eating on you, kid?"</p>

<p>"Aw, this bunk in the paper," replied Ferguson. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
he glared at me and enquired, "Did you write this stuff?"</p>

<p>"What stuff?" I replied. "Read it out."</p>

<p>Ferguson picked up the paper and began to read in
mocking tones something that went as follows:</p>

<p>"Isn't it beautiful in the cold early dawn in France, to
see our dear American soldiers get up from their bunks
and go whistling down to the stables to take care of
their beloved animals."</p>

<p>English laughed uproariously.</p>

<p>"The Kid don't like horses no more than I do," he
said. "Neither one of us have got any use for them
at all. And here, that's all they keep us doing, is tending
horses. I went down there the other morning with a
lantern and one of them long-eared babies just kicked it
clean out of my hand. The other morning one of them
planted two hoofs right on Ferguson's chest and knocked
him clear out of the stable. It broke his watch and
his girl's picture.</p>

<p>"You know, Mr. Gibbons, I never did have any use
for horses. When I was about eight years old a horse
bit me. When I was about fifteen years old I got run
over by an ice-wagon. Horses is just been the ruination
of me.</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been for them I might have gone through
college and been an officer in this here army. You remember
that great big dairy out on the edge of the
town in El Paso? Well, my dad owned that and he lost
all of it on the ponies in Juarez. I just hate horses.</p>

<p>"I know everything there is to know about an automobile.
I have driven cross country automobile races
and after we come out of Mexico, after we didn't get
Villa, I went to work in the army machine shops at
Fort Bliss and took down all them motor trucks and
built them all over again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"When Uncle Sam got into the war against Germany,
this here Artillery Battalion was stationed out at Fort
Bliss, and I went to see the Major about enlisting, but
I told him I didn't want to have nothing to do with no
horses.</p>

<p>"And he says, 'English, don't you bother about that.
You join up with this here battalion, because when we
leave for France we're going to kiss good-bye to them
horses forever. This here battalion is going to be motorised.'</p>

<p>"And now here we are in France, and we still got
horses, and they don't like me and I don't like them, and
yet I got to mill around with 'em every day. The Germans
ain't never going to kill me. They ain't going to
get a chance. They just going to find me trampled to
death some morning down in that stable."</p>

<p>Two or three of the occupants of nearby beds had
arisen and taken seats on English's bed. They joined
the conversation. One red-headed youngster, wearing
heavy flannel underwear in lieu of pajamas, made the
first contribution to the discussion.</p>

<p>"That's just what I'm beefing about," he said. "Here
I've been in this army two months now and I'm still a
private. There ain't no chance here for a guy that's got
experience."</p>

<p>"Experience? Where do you get that experience
talk?" demanded English. "What do you know about
artillery?"</p>

<p>"That's just what I mean, experience," the red-headed
one replied with fire. "I got experience. Mr. Gibbons
knows me. I'm from Chicago, the same as he is. I
worked in Chicago at Riverview Park. I'm the guy that
fired the gattling gun in the Monitor and Merrimac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
show&mdash;we had two shows a day and two shows in the
evening and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kin you beat that," demanded English. "You know,
if this here red-headed guy don't get promotion pretty
quick, he's just simply going to quit this army and
leave us flat here in France facing the Germans.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you about this gattling gun expert. When
they landed us off of them boats down on the coast, the
battalion commander turned us all loose for a swim in
the bay, and this here bird almost drowned. He went
down three times before we could pull him out.</p>

<p>"Now, if they don't make him a Brigadier General
pretty quick, he's going to get sore and put in for a
transfer to the Navy on the grounds of having submarine
experience. But he's right in one thing&mdash;experience
don't count for what it should in the army.</p>

<p>"Right here in our battery we got a lot of plough
boys from Kansas that have been sitting on a plough and
looking at a horse's back all their lives, and they got
them handling the machinery on these here guns. And
me, who knows everything there is to know about machinery,
they won't let me even find out which end of
the cannon you put the shell in and which end it comes
out of. All I do all day long is to prod around a couple
of fat-hipped hayburners. My God, I hate horses."</p>

<p>But regardless of these inconveniences those first
American artillerymen in our overseas forces applied
themselves strenuously to their studies. They were there
primarily to learn. It became necessary for them at first
to make themselves forget a lot of things that they had
previously learned by artillery and adapt themselves to
new methods and instruments of war.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear of "Swansant, Kansas"? You
probably won't find it on any train schedule in the Sunflower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
State; in fact, it isn't a place at all. It is the
name of the light field cannon that France provided our
men for use against the German line.</p>

<p>"Swansant, Kansas" is phonetic spelling of the name
as pronounced by American gunners. The French got
the same effect in pronunciation by spelling the singular
"soixante quinze," but a Yankee cannoneer trying to pronounce
it from that orthography was forced to call it a
"quince," and that was something which it distinctly
was not.</p>

<p>One way or the other it meant the "Seventy-fives"&mdash;the
"Admirable Seventy-five"&mdash;the seventy-five millimetre
field pieces that stopped the Germans' Paris drive
at the Marne&mdash;the same that gave Little Willie a headache
at Verdun,&mdash;the inimitable, rapid firing, target
hugging, hell raising, shell spitting engine of destruction
whose secret of recoil remained a secret after almost
twenty years and whose dependability was a French proverb.</p>

<p>At Valdahon where American artillery became acquainted
with the Seventy-five, the khaki-clad gun crews
called her "some cannon." At seven o'clock every morning,
the glass windows in my room at the post would
rattle with her opening barks, and from that minute on
until noon the Seventy-fives, battery upon battery of
them, would snap and bark away until their seemingly
ceaseless fire becomes a volley of sharp cracks which
sent the echoes chasing one another through the dark recesses
of the forests that conceal them.</p>

<p>The targets, of course, were unseen. Range elevation,
deflection, all came to the battery over the signal wires
that connected the firing position with some observation
point also unseen but located in a position commanding
the terrain under fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>A signalman sat cross-legged on the ground back of
each battery. He received the firing directions from the
transmitter clamped to his ears and conveyed them to
the firing executive who stood beside him. They were
then megaphoned to the sergeants chief of sections.</p>

<p>The corporal gunner, with eye on the sighting instruments
at the side of each gun, "laid the piece" for range
and deflection. Number one man of the crew opened
the block to receive the shell, which was inserted by
number two. Number three adjusted the fuse-setter,
and cut the fuses. Numbers four and five screwed the
fuses in the shells and kept the fuse-setter loaded.</p>

<p>The section chiefs, watch in hand, gave the firing command
to the gun crews, and number one of each piece
jerked the firing lanyard at ten second intervals or whatever
interval the command might call for. The four
guns would discharge their projectiles. They whined over
the damp wooded ridge to distant imaginary lines of
trenches, theoretical cross-roads, or designated sections
where the enemy was supposed to be massing for attack.
Round after round would follow, while telephoned corrections
perfected the range, and burst. The course of
each shell was closely observed as well as its bursting
effect, but no stupendous records were kept of the individual
shots. That was "peace time stuff."</p>

<p>These batteries and regiments were learning gunnery
and no scarcity of shells was permitted to interfere with
their education. One officer told me that it was his
opinion that one brigade firing at this schooling post
during a course of six weeks, had expended more ammunition
than all of the field artillery of the United
States Army has fired during the entire period since the
Civil War. The Seventy-five shells cost approximately
ten dollars apiece, but neither the French nor American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
artillery directors felt that a penny's worth was being
wasted. They said cannon firing could not be learned
entirely out of a book.</p>

<p>I had talked with a French instructor, a Yale graduate,
who had been two years with the guns at the front, and
I had asked him what in his opinion was the most disconcerting
thing that could happen to effect the morale
of new gunners under actual fire. I wanted some idea
of what might be expected of American artillerymen
when they made their initial appearance on the line.</p>

<p>We discussed the effect of counter battery fire, the
effect on gun crews of asphyxiating gas, either that carried
on the wind from the enemy trenches or that sent
over in gas shells. We considered the demoralising influences
of aerial attacks on gun positions behind the line.</p>

<p>"They are all bad," my informant concluded. "But
they are expected. Men can stand without complaint and
without qualm any danger that is directed at them by the
foe they are fighting. The thing that really bothers,
though, is the danger of death or injury from their own
weapons or ammunition. You see, many times there
is such a thing as a faulty shell, although careful inspection
in the munitions plants has reduced this danger
to a percentage of about one in ten thousand.</p>

<p>"At the beginning of the war when every little tin
shop all over the world was converted into a munitions
factory to supply the great need of shells, much faulty
ammunition reached the front lines. Some of the shells
would explode almost as soon as they left the gun. They
are called shorts. The English, who had the same trouble,
call them 'muzzle bursts.'</p>

<p>"Sometimes the shell would explode in the bore of the
cannon, in which case the cannoneers were usually killed
either by pieces of the shell itself or bits of the cannon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
The gunners have to sit beside the cannon when it is
fired, and the rest of the gun crew are all within eight
feet of it. If there is an explosion in the breech of the
gun, it usually wipes out most of the crew. A muzzle
burst, or a breech explosion, is one of the most disconcerting
things that could happen in a battery.</p>

<p>"The other men in the battery know of course that a
faulty shell caused the explosion. They also know that
they are firing ammunition from the same lot. After
that, as they pull the trigger on each shot, they don't
know whether the shell is going out of the gun all right
or whether it is going to explode in the breech and kill
all of them. That thought in a man's mind when he
pulls the firing lanyard, that thought in the minds of the
whole crew as they stand there waiting for the crash, is
positively demoralising.</p>

<p>"When it happens in our French artillery the cannoneers
lose confidence in their pieces. They build small
individual dugouts a safe ways back from the gun and
extend the lanyard a safe distance. Then, with all the
gun crew under cover, they fire the piece. This naturally
removes them from their regular firing positions beside
the pieces, reduces the accuracy and slows up the entire
action of the battery. The men's suspicions of the shells
combined with the fear of death by their own weapons,
which is greater than any fear of death at the hands of
the enemy, all reduce the morale of the gun crews."</p>

<p>Now, for an incident. A new shipment of ammunition
had reached the post. The caissons were filled with it.
Early the following morning when the guns rumbled
out of camp to the practice grounds, Battery X was firing
in the open. At the third shot the shell from piece number
two exploded prematurely thirty yards from the muzzle.
Pieces three and four fired ten and twenty seconds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
later with every man standing on his toes in his prescribed
position.</p>

<p>Ten rounds later, a shell from number three gun exploded
thirty feet after leaving the bore. Shell particles
buried themselves in the ground near the battery. Piece
number four, right next to it, was due to fire in ten
seconds. It discharged its projectiles on the dot.
The gun crews knew what they were up against. They
were firing faulty ammunition. They passed whispered
remarks but reloaded with more of the same ammunition
and with military precision on the immediate command.
Every man stuck to his position. As each gun was fired
the immediate possibilities were not difficult to imagine.</p>

<p>Then it happened.</p>

<p>"Commence firing," megaphoned the firing executive.
The section chief of number one piece dropped his right
hand as the signal for the discharge. The corporal gunner
was sitting on the metal seat in front of his instruments
and not ten inches to the left of the breech. Cannoneer
number one of the gun crew occupied his prescribed
position in the same location to the immediate
right of the breech. Gunner number two was standing
six feet behind the breech and slightly to the left ready
to receive the ejected cartridge case. Gunner number
three was kneeling over the fuse setter behind the caisson
which stood wheel to wheel with the gun carriage. Gunners
four and five were rigid statues three feet back of
him. Every man in the crew had seen the previous bursts
of dangerous ammunition.</p>

<p>Number one's eye caught the descending hand of the
section chief. He pulled the lanyard.</p>

<p>There was an eruption of orange coloured flame, a
deafening roar, a crash of rendered steel, a cloud of
smoke blue green, and yellow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>A black chunk of the gun cradle hurtled backward
through the air with a vicious swish. A piece of the
bore splintered the wheels and buried itself in the ammunition
caisson. Thick hunks of gun metal crumbling
like dry cake filled the air. The ground shook.</p>

<p>The corporal gunner pitched backward from his seat
and collapsed on the ground. His mate with fists buried
in his steel seared eyes staggered out of the choking
fumes. The rest of the crew picked themselves up in a
dazed condition. Fifty yards away a horse was struggling
to regain his feet.</p>

<p>Every man in the three other gun crews knew what
had happened. None of them moved from their posts.
They knew their guns were loaded with shells from the
same lot and possibly with the same faults. No man
knew what would happen when the next firing pin went
home. The evidence was before them. Their eyes were
on the exploded gun but not for long.</p>

<p>"Crash," the ten second firing interval had expired.
The section chief of piece number two had dropped his
hand. The second gun in the battery had fired.</p>

<p>"Number two on the way," sang out the signalman
over the telephone wire to the hidden observation station.</p>

<p>Ten seconds more for another gun crew to cogitate on
whether disaster hung on the dart of a firing pin.</p>

<p>"Crash."</p>

<p>"Number three on the way."</p>

<p>Another ten seconds for the last section to wonder
whether death would come with the lanyard jerk.</p>

<p>"Crash."</p>

<p>"Number four on the way." Round complete. The
signalman finished his telephone report.</p>

<p>Four horses drawing an army ambulance galloped up
from the ravine that sheltered them. The corporal gunner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
unconscious and with one leg pulverised was lifted
in. Two other dazed members of the crew were helped
into the vehicle. One was bleeding from the shoulder.
The lead horses swung about; the ambulance rattled
away.</p>

<p>"Battery ready to fire. Piece number one out of action."
It was the signalman reporting over the wire to
the observer.</p>

<p>Battery X fired the rest of the morning and they used
ammunition from the same lot and every man knew
what might happen any minute and every man was in
his exact position for every shot and nobody happened
to think about hiding in a dugout and putting a long
string on the firing lanyard.</p>

<p>It had been an unstaged, unconscious demonstration
of nerve and grit and it proved beyond all question the
capacity of American artillerymen to stand by the guns.</p>

<p>The gunner corporal told the nurse at his bedside how
it all happened, but he was still under the effects of the
anesthetic. He did not refer to the morale of his battery
mates because it had not occurred to him that there was
anything unusual in what they did. But he did think
that he could wiggle the toes on his right leg. The doctor
told me that this was a common delusion before the
patient had been informed of the amputation.</p>

<p>Incidents such as the one related had no effect whatever
upon the progress of the work. From early dawn
to late at night the men followed their strenuous duties
six days a week and then obtained the necessary relief on
the seventh day by trips down to the ancient town of
Besançon.</p>

<p>In this picturesque country where countless thousands
fought and died, down through the bloody centuries since
and before the Christian era, where Julius Cæsar paused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
in his far flung raids to dictate new inserts to his commentaries,
where kings and queens and dukes and pretenders
left undying traces of ambition's stormy urgings,
there it was that American soldiers, in training for the
war of wars, spent week-end holidays and mixed the
breath of romance with the drag of their cigarettes.</p>

<p>The extender of Roman borders divided that region
into three parts, according to the testimony of the first
Latin class, but he neglected to mention that of these
three parts the one decreed for American occupation was
the most romantic of them all.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It is late on a Saturday afternoon and I accept the
major's offer of a seat in his mud-bespattered "Hunka
Tin." The field guns have ceased their roar for the
day and their bores will be allowed to cool over Sunday.
Five per cent. of the men at the post have received the
coveted town leave.</p>

<p>They form a khaki fresco on the cab and sides of the
giant commissary trucks that raise the dust along the
winding white road over the hills. Snorting motorcycles
with two men over the motor and an officer in
the side car skim over the ground, passing all others. A
lukewarm sun disappears in a slot in the mountains and
a blue grey mist forms in the valleys. A chill comes
over the air and a cold new moon looks down and laughs.</p>

<p>It is a long ride to the ancient town, but speed laws
and motor traps are unknown and the hood of the Detroit
Dilemma shakes like a wet dog as her sizzling hot
cylinders suck juice from a full throttle. We cross one
divide through a winding road bordered by bushy trees
and as orderly as a national park. We coast through
a hillside hamlet of barking dogs and saluting children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
who stand at smiling attention and greet our passage
with a shrill "Veev La Mereek" (Vive l'Amérique).</p>

<p>We scud across a broad, level road built well above
the lowland, and climb through zig-zagging avenues of
stately poplars to the tunnel that pierces the backbone of
the next ridge.</p>

<p>While the solid rock walls of the black bore reverberate
with the echoes from our exhaust, we emerge on a
road that turns sharply to the left and hugs a cliff. Below
winds a broad river that looks like mother of pearl
in the moonlight. The mountain walls on either side
rise at angles approximating 45 degrees, and in the light
their orderly vineyards look like the squares on a sloping
checkerboard. In front of us and to the right the flanking
ridges converge to a narrow gorge through which
the river Doub runs to loop the town.</p>

<p>Commanding this gorge from the crests of the two
rocky heights are sinister sentinels whose smooth, grey
walls and towers rise sheer from the brink of the cliffs.
The moonlight now catching the ramparts of the em-battlements
splashes them with strokes of white that
seem ever brighter in contrast with the darker shadows
made by projecting portions of the walls. Spaniard
and Moor knew well those walls, and all the kingly
glory that hurried France to the reign of terror has slept
within their shadows.</p>

<p>Our way down the cliff side is hewn out of the beetling
rock. To our left, a jagged wall of rock rises to the sky.
To our right, a step, rock-tumbled declivity drops to
the river's edge.</p>

<p>The moonlight brings funny fancies, and our yellow
headlights, wavering in concentric arcs with each turn
of the course, almost seem to glint on the helmets and
shields of the spear-bearing legionaries that marched that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
very way to force a southern culture on the Gauls. We
slow down to pass through the rock-hewn gate that once
was the Roman aqueduct bringing water down from
mountain springs to the town.</p>

<p>Through the gate, a turn to the left and we reach the
black bottom of the gorge untouched by the rising moon.
We face a blast of wind that slows our speed and brings
with it the first big drops of rain. We stop at the
"Octroi" and assure the customs collector that we are
military, and that we carry no dutiable wine, or beans
or wood into the town.</p>

<p>Yet another gate, built across the narrow road between
the cliff and the river, and we enter the town. It has
been raining and the cobblestones are slippery. They
shine in the gleams of pale light that come from the top-heavy
street lamps. Gargoyle water spouts drip drainage
from the gables of moss-speckled tiles.</p>

<p>We pass a fountain that the Romans left, and rounded
arches further on show where the hooded Moor wrote
his name in masonry. Barred windows and stone balconies
projecting over the street take one's mind off the
rattling motor and cause it to wander back to times when
serenading lovers twanged guitars beneath their ladies'
windows and were satisfied with the flower that dropped
from the balcony.</p>

<p>The streets are wet and dark now and through their
narrow windings our headlights reveal tall figures in
slickers or khaki overcoats topped by peaked felt hats
with the red cords of American artillerymen. Their
identification is a surprise to the dreamer, because one
rather expects these figures to sulk in the deeper shadows
and screen their dark, bearded faces with the broad brims
of black felt hats or muffle themselves to the chin in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
long, flowing black cloaks that hide rapiers and stilettos
and other properties of mediæval charm.</p>

<p>We dine in a room three hundred years old. The presence
of our automobile within the inner quadrangle of the
ancient building jars on the sense of fitness. It is an old
convent, now occupied by irreligious tenants on the
upper three floors, restaurants and estaminets on the
lower floor. These shops open on a broad gallery, level
with the courtyard, and separated from it only by the
rows of pillars that support the arches. It extends
around the four sides of the court.</p>

<p>Centuries ago shrouded nuns, clasping beads or books
of office, walked in uncommunicative pairs and mumbled
their daily prayers beneath these time-worn arches,
and to-night it affords a promenade for officers waiting
for their meals to be served at madame's well laid
tables within.</p>

<p>Madame's tables are not too many. There is not the
space economy of an American café, where elbows interlock
and waiters are forced to navigate fearsome cargoes
above the diners' heads. Neither is there the unwholesome,
dust-filled carpet of London's roast beef palaces.</p>

<p>Madame's floor is bare, but the wood has stood the
scrubbings of years, and is as spotless as grass-dried
linen. The high ceiling and the walls are of white
stucco. In bas-relief are clusters of heraldic signs, of
bishops' crooks and cathedral keys, of mounted chargers
and dying dragoons, of miter and crown, and trumpet
and shield, and cross.</p>

<p>Large mirrors, circled with wreaths of gilded leaves,
adorn both end walls, and beneath one of them remains
an ornate fireplace and mantelpiece of bologna coloured
marble, surmounted with a gilt cock of wondrous design.
Beneath the other mirror madame has placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
her buffet, on which the boy who explores the dusty
caves below places the cobwebbed bottles of red wine
for the last cork pulling. Large gold chandeliers, dangling
with glass prisms, are suspended from high ceiling
and flood the room with light, against which the inner
shutters of the tall windows must be shut because of
danger from the sky.</p>

<p>There is colour in that room. The Roman conquerors
would have found it interesting. If former armed occupants
of the old town could have paraded in their
ancient habiliments through the room like a procession
from the martial past, they would have found much for
their attention in this scene of the martial present.
American khaki seems to predominate, although at several
tables are Canadian officers in uniforms of the
same colour but of different tailoring.</p>

<p>The tables are flecked with all varieties of French
uniforms, from scarlet pants with solitary black stripes
down the leg, to tunics of horizon blue. In one corner
there are two turbaned Algerians with heads bent close
over their black coffee, and one horn of the hall rack
shows a red fez with a gold crescent on the crown.</p>

<p>Consider the company. That freckle-faced youth
with the fluffed reddish hair of a bandmaster is a French
aviator, and among the row of decorations on his dark
blue coat is one that he received by reason of a well
known adventure over the German lines, which cannot
be mentioned here. That American colonel whose short
grey hair blends into the white wall behind him is a
former member of the United States war college and
one of the most important factors in the legislation
that shaped the present military status of his country.
That other Frenchman with the unusual gold shoulder
straps is not a member of the French army. He is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
naval officer, and the daring with which he carried his
mapping chart along exposed portions of the line at Verdun
and evolved the mathematical data on which the
French fired their guns against the German waves has
been the pride of both the navy and the army.</p>

<p>Over there is a young captain who this time last year
was a "shavetail" second in command at a small post
along the line of communications in Chihuahua. Next
to him sits a tall dark youngster wearing with pride
his first Sam Browne belt and "U. S. R." on his collar.
He carted human wreckage to the hospitals on the
French front for two years before Uncle Sam decided
to end the war. There's another one not long from
the "Point," booted and spurred and moulded to his
uniform. He speaks with a twang of old Virginia on
every syllable and they say his family&mdash;but that has
nothing to do with the fact that he is aid to a major
general and is in these parts on a mission.</p>

<p>There are three American women in the room. One
who is interested in Y. M. C. A. work and a number
of newspapers, wears a feminine adaptation of the uniform
and holds court at the head of a table of five officers.
Another, Mrs. Robert R. McCormick, who is engaged
in the extension of the canteen work of a Paris
organisation, is sitting at our table and she is willing to
wager her husband anything from half a dozen gloves
to a big donation check that Germany will be ready for
any kind of peace before an American offensive in the
spring.</p>

<p>The interests of the other American woman are negative.
She professes no concern in the fact that war correspondents'
life insurances are cancelled, but she repeats
to me that a dead correspondent is of no use to his paper,
and I reply that if madame puts yet another one of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
courses on the board, one correspondent will die with a
fork in his hand instead of a pencil.</p>

<p>The diners are leaving. Each opening of the salon
door brings in a gust of dampness that makes the tablecloths
flap. Rain coats swish and rustle in the entry.
Rain is falling in sheets in the black courtyard. The
moon is gone.</p>

<p>A merry party trails down the stone gallery skirting
the quadrangle. Their hobnailed soles and steel plated
heels ring on the stone flags. The arches echo back their
song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In days of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A warrior bold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sang merrily his lay, etc. etc. etc.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My love is young and fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My love has golden hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So what care I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though death be nigh, etc. etc. etc."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With frequent passages where a dearth of words reduce
the selection to musical but meaningless ta-de-ta-tas,
the voices melt into the blackness and the rain.</p>

<p>"Great times to be alive," I say to the wife. "This
place is saturated with romance. I don't have to be
back to the post until to-morrow night. Where will we
go? They are singing 'Carmen' in the old opera house
on the square. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"There's a Charlie Chaplin on the programme next to
the hotel," the wife replies.</p>

<p>Romance was slapped with a custard pie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>"FRONTWARD HO!"</h3>


<p>When the artillery training had proceeded to such a
point that the French instructors were congratulating
our officers upon their proficiency, the rumours spread
through the post that the brigade had been ordered to
go to the front&mdash;that we were to be the first American
soldiers to actually go into the line and face the Germans.</p>

<p>The news was received with joy. The men were keen
to try out their newly acquired abilities upon the enemy.
Harness was polished until it shone. Brass equipment
gleamed until you could almost see your face in it. The
men groomed the horses until the animals got pains
from it. Enlisted men sojourning in the Guard House
for petty offences, despatched their guards with scrawled
pleadings that the sentences be changed to fines so that
they could accompany the outfits to the front.</p>

<p>With one special purpose in view, I made application
to General March for an assignment to Battery A of
the Sixth Field Artillery. I received the appointment.
The Sixth was the first regiment of the brigade and A
was the first battery of the regiment. I knew that we
would march out in that order, that Battery A would
entrain first, detrain first, go in the line first, and I hoped
to be present at the firing of the first American shot in
the war.</p>

<p>We pulled out of the post on schedule time early in
the morning, two days later. Officers and men had
been up and dressed since midnight. Ten minutes after
their arising, blankets had been rolled and all personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
equipment packed ready for departure with the exception
of mess kits.</p>

<p>While the stable police details fed the horses, the rest
of us "leaned up against" steak, hot biscuits, syrup and
hot coffee. The cook had been on the job all night and
his efforts touched the right spot. It seemed as if it
was the coldest hour of the night and the hot "chow"
acted as a primer on the sleepy human machines.</p>

<p>In the darkness, the animals were packed into the
gun carriages and caissons down in the gun park, and
it was 4 A. M. on the dot when the captain's whistle
sounded and we moved off the reserve. As we rattled
over the railroad crossing and took the road, the men
made facetious good-byes to the scene of their six weeks'
training.</p>

<p>Soldiers like movement&mdash;we were on the move. Every
one's spirits were up and the animals were frisky and
high-stepping in the brisk air. Chains rattled as some
of the lead pairs mussed up the traces and were brought
back into alignment by the drivers. The cannoneers,
muffled in great coats, hung on the caisson seats and
chided the drivers.</p>

<p>We were off. Where we were going, seemed to make
no difference. Rumours could never be depended upon,
so none of us knew our destination, but all of us hoped
that we were going into action. Every man in the battery
felt that the schooling was over and that the battery,
if given a chance, could prove that it needed no further
training.</p>

<p>At the same time, some of the men expressed the fear
that we were on our way to some other training camp
for some post-graduate course in firing or maybe for
the purpose of instructing other less advanced batteries.
The final consensus of opinion was, however, that "beefing"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
about our prospects wouldn't change them, and that
anything was better than staying in the same place forever.</p>

<p>Two miles from the post the road crossed the railroad
tracks. The crossing bore a name as everything
else did in that land of poetical nomenclature. There was
only one house there. It was an old grey stone cottage,
its walls covered with vines, and its garden full of
shrubbery. It was occupied by three persons, the old
crossing-tender, his wife&mdash;and one other. That other
was Jeanne. Jeanne was their daughter.</p>

<p>We had seen her many times as she opened the crossing
gates for traffic on the road. She was about sixteen
years old. Her ankles were encased in thick grey woollen
hose of her own knitting and, where they emerged from
her heavy wooden shoes, it looked as if every move
in her clumsy footgear might break them off.</p>

<p>As we approached the crossing, Gallagher, who rode
one of the lead pair on piece No. 2, began to give vent
to his fine Irish tenor. Gallagher was singing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We were sailing along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Moonlight bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You could hear the voices ringing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They seemed to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'You have stolen my heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, don't go away,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As we kissed and said good-bye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Moonlight bay."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It would almost have seemed that there was need of
some explanation for Gallagher's musical demonstration
on this cold, dark morning, but none was demanded.
Gallagher apparently knew what he was doing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>His pair of lead horses were walking in much too
orderly a fashion for the occasion. Apparently the
occasion demanded a little greater show of dash and
spirit. Gallagher sunk his spurs into the flanks of his
mount and punched its mate in the ribs with the heavy
handle of his riding crop.</p>

<p>The leads lunged forward against their collars. The
sudden plunge was accompanied by a jangle of chains
as the traces tightened. The gun carriage jolted and
the cannoneers swore at the unnecessary bouncing.</p>

<p>"Easy, Zigg-Zigg, whoa, Fini." Gallagher pulled on
the lines as he shouted in a calculated pitch the French
names of his horses. And then the reason for Gallagher's
conduct developed.</p>

<p>A pair of wooden shutters on a first floor window of
the gate-tender's cottage opened outward. In the window
was a lamp. The yellow rays from it shone upward
and revealed a tumbled mass of long black hair,
black eyes that gleamed, red cheeks and red lips. Then
a sweet voice said:</p>

<p>"Gude-bye, Meeky."</p>

<p>"Orry wore, Jeen," replied Gallagher.</p>

<p>"<i>Après la guerre</i>, Meeky," said Jeanne.</p>

<p>"Orry wore, Jeen," repeated Gallagher.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jeanie, dear, please call me 'Meeky,'" sang out
one of the men, astride one of the wheel pair of the
same gun.</p>

<p>The window had closed, but before the light disappeared,
black eyes flashed hate at the jester, and Gallagher,
himself, two horses ahead, turned in the saddle
and told the taunter to shut his mouth, observing at the
same time that "some guys didn't know a decent girl
when they saw one."</p>

<p>We rode on. Soon, on the left, the sun came up cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
out of Switzerland's white topped ridges miles away,
and smiling frigidly across the snow-clad neutral Alps,
dispelled the night mist in our part of the world.</p>

<p>The battery warmed under its glow. Village after
village we passed through, returning the polite salutes
of early rising grand-sires who uncovered their grey
heads, or wrinkled, pink-faced grandmothers, who waved
kerchiefs from gabled windows beneath the thatch and
smiled the straight and dry-lipped smile of toothless age
as they wished us good fortune in the war.</p>

<p>We messed at midday by the roadside, green fields
and hills of France, our table decorations, cold beef
and dry bread, our fare, with canteens full to wash it
down. When the horses had tossed their nose-bags futilely
for the last grains of oats, and the captain's watch
had timed the rest at three-quarters of the hour, we
mounted and resumed the march.</p>

<p>The equipment rode easy on man and beast. Packs
had been shifted to positions of maximum comfort.
The horses were still fresh enough to need tight rein.
The men had made final adjustments to the chin straps
on their new steel helmets and these sat well on heads
that never before had been topped with armoured covering.
In addition to all other equipment, each man carried
two gas masks. Our top sergeant had an explanation
for me as to this double gas mask equipment.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you about it," he said, as he ruthlessly accepted
the next-to-the-last twenty-five centime Egyptian
cigarette from my proffered case. I winced as he deliberately
tore the paper from that precious fine smoke and
inserted the filler in his mouth for a chew.</p>

<p>"You see, England and France and us is all Allies,"
he said. "Both of them loves us and we love both of
them. We don't know nothing about gas masks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
they knows all there is to know about them. The French
say their gas mask is the best. The British say their gas
mask is the best.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, they both offer us gas masks. Now
Uncle Sam don't want to hurt nobody's feelings, so he
says, 'Gentlemen, we won't fight about this here matter.
We'll just use both gas masks, and give each of
them a try-out.'</p>

<p>"So here we are carrying two of these human nose-bags.
The first time we get into a mess of this here
gas, somebody will send the order around to change
masks in the middle of it&mdash;just to find out which is the
best one."</p>

<p>The sergeant, with seeming malice, spat some of that
fine cigarette on a roadside kilometer stone and closed
the international prospects of the subject.</p>

<p>Our battery jangled through a tunnelled ridge and
emerged on the other side just as a storm of rain and
hail burst with mountain fury. The hailstones rattled
on our metal helmets and the men laughed at the sound
as they donned slickers. The brakes grated on the caisson
wheels as we took the steep down-grade. The road
hugged the valley wall which was a rugged, granite cliff.</p>

<p>I rode on ahead through the stinging hailstones and
watched our battery as it passed through the historic
rock-hewn gateway that is the entrance to the mediæval
town of Besançon. The portal is located at a sharp turn
of the river. The gateway is carved through a mountain
spur. Ancient doors of iron-studded oak still guard
the entrance, but they have long since stood open. Battlements
that once knew the hand of Vaubon frown
down in ancient menace to any invader.</p>

</div>

<p>No Roman conqueror at the head of his invading
legions ever rode through that triumphal arch with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
greater pride than rode our little captain at the head
of his battery. Our little captain was in stature the
smallest man in our battery, but he compensated for
that by riding the tallest horse in the battery.</p>

<p>He carried his head at a jaunty angle. He wore his
helmet at a nifty tilt, with the chin strap riding between
his underlip and his dimpled, upheld chin. He carried
his shoulders back, and his chest out. The reins hung
gracefully in his left hand, and he had assumed a rather
moving-picture pose of the right fist on his right hip.
Behind him flew the red guidon, its stirruped staff held
stiffly at the right arm's length by the battery standard
bearer.</p>

<p>Both of them smiled&mdash;expansive smiles of pride&mdash;into
the clicking lens of my camera. I forgave our little
captain for his smile of pride. I knew that six weeks
before that very day our little captain had fitted into
the scheme of civilian life as a machinery salesman from
Indiana. And there that day, he rode at the head of his
two hundred and fifty fighting men and horses, at the
head of his guns, rolling down that road in France on
the way to the front.</p>

<p>In back of him and towering upward, was that historic
rock that had known the tread and passage of countless
martial footsteps down through the centuries. Behind
him, the gun carriages rattled through the frowning
portal. Oh, if the folks back on the Wabash could
have seen him then!</p>

<p>We wound through the crooked narrow streets of
Besançon, our steel-tired wheels bounding and banging
over the cobblestones. Townsfolk waved to us from
windows and doorways. Old women in the market
square abandoned their baskets of beet roots and beans
to flutter green stained aprons in our direction. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
column was flanked by clattering phalanxes of wooden-shoed
street gamins, who must have known more about
our movements than we did, because they all shouted,
"Gude-bye."</p>

<p>Six weeks' familiarity between these same artillerymen
on town leave and these same urchins had temporised
the blind admiration that caused them first to greet
our men solely with shouts of "<i>Vive les Américains</i>."
Now that they knew us better, they alternated the old
greeting with shouts of that all-meaning and also meaningless
French expression, "Oo la la."</p>

<p>Our way led over the stone, spanned bridge that
crossed the sluggish river through the town, and on to
the hilly outskirts where mounted French guides met
and directed us to the railroad loading platform.</p>

<p>The platform was a busy place. The regimental supply
company which was preceding us over the road was
engaged in forcibly persuading the last of its mules to
enter the toy freight cars which bore on the side the
printed legend, "Hommes 40, Chevaux 8."</p>

<p>Several arclights and one or two acetylene flares illuminated
the scene. It was raining fitfully, but not
enough to dampen the spirits of the Y. M. C. A. workers
who wrestled with canvas tarpaulins and foraged materials
to construct a make-shift shelter for a free coffee
and sandwich counter.</p>

<p>Their stoves were burning brightly and the hurriedly
erected stove pipes, leaning wearily against the stone
wall enclosing the quay, topped the wall like a miniature
of the sky line of Pittsburgh. The boiling coffee pots
gave off a delicious steam. In the language of our battery,
the "Whime say" delivered the goods.</p>

<p>During it all the mules brayed and the supply company
men swore. Most humans, cognizant of the principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of safety first, are respectful of the rear quarters
of a mule. We watched one disrespecter of these principles
invite what might have been called "mulecide"
with utter contempt for the consequences. He deliberately
stood in the dangerous immediate rear of one particularly
onery mule, and kicked the mule.</p>

<p>His name was "Missouri Slim," as he took pains to
inform the object of his caress. He further announced
to all present, men and mules, that he had been brought
up with mules from babyhood and knew mules from the
tips of their long ears to the ends of their hard tails.</p>

<p>The obdurate animal in question had refused to enter
the door of the car that had been indicated as his Pullman.
"Missouri Slim" called three other ex-natives of
Champ Clark's state to his assistance. They fearlessly
put a shoulder under each of the mule's quarters. Then
they grunted a unanimous "heave," and lifted the struggling
animal off its feet. As a perfect matter of course,
they walked right into the car with him with no more
trouble than if he had been an extra large bale of hay.</p>

<p>"Wonderful mule handling in this here army," remarked
a quiet, mild-mannered man in uniform, beside
whom I happened to be standing. He spoke with a slow,
almost sleepy, drawl. He was the new veterinarian of
the supply company, and there were a number of things
that were new to him, as his story revealed. He was the
first homesick horse doctor I ever met.</p>

<p>"I come from a small town out in Iowa," he told me.
"I went to a veterinary college and had a nice little practice,&mdash;sorter
kept myself so busy that I never got much
of a chance to think about this here war. But one day,
about two months ago, I got a letter from the War Department
down in Washington.</p>

<p>"They said the hoss doctor college had given them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
my name as one of the graduates and the letter said
that the War Department was making out a list of
hoss doctors. The letter asked me to fill out the blank
and send it to Washington.</p>

<p>"'Joe,' my wife says to me, 'this here is an honour that
the country is paying to you. The Government just
wants the names of the patriotic professional citizens of
the country.' So we filled out the blank and mailed it
and forgot all about it.</p>

<p>"Well, about two weeks later, I got a letter from
Washington telling me to go at once to Douglas, Arizona.
It sorter scared the wife and me at first because neither
of us had ever been out of Iowa, but I told her that
I was sure it wasn't anything serious&mdash;I thought that
Uncle Sam just had some sick hosses down there and
wanted me to go down and look them over.</p>

<p>"Well, the wife put another shirt and a collar and
an extra pair of socks in my hand satchel along with
my instruments and I kissed her and the little boy good-bye
and told them that I would hurry up and prescribe
for the Government hosses and be back in about five
days.</p>

<p>"Two days later I landed in Douglas, and a major
shoved me into a uniform and told me I was commissioned
as a hoss doctor lieutenant. That afternoon I
was put on a train with a battery and we were on our
way east. Six days later we were on the ocean. We
landed somewhere in France and moved way out here.</p>

<p>"My wife was expecting me back in five days and here
it is I've been away two months and I haven't had a
letter from her and now we're moving up to the front.
It seems to me like I've been away from Iowa for ten
years, and I guess I am a little homesick, but it sure is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
a comfort to travel with an outfit that knows how to
handle mules like this one does."</p>

<p>The supply company completed loading, and the homesick
horse doctor boarded the last car as the train moved
down the track. Our battery took possession of the
platform. A train of empties was shunted into position
and we began loading guns and wagons on the flat cars
and putting the animals into the box cars.</p>

<p>Considerable confusion accompanied this operation.
The horses seemed to have decided scruples against entering
the cars. It was dark and the rain came down
miserably. The men swore. There was considerable
kicking on the part of the men as well as the animals.</p>

<p>I noticed one group that was gathered around a plunging
team of horses. The group represented an entanglement
of rope, harness, horses and men. I heard a clang
of metal and saw the flash of two steel-shod hoofs. A
little corporal, holding his head up with both hands,
backed out of the group,&mdash;backed clear across the platform
and sat down on a bale of hay.</p>

<p>I went to his assistance. Blood was trickling through
his fingers. I washed his two scalp wounds with water
from a canteen and applied first aid bandages.</p>

<p>"Just my luck," I heard my patient mumbling as I
swathed his head in white strips and imparted to him
the appearance of a first-class front line casualty.</p>

<p>"You're lucky," I told him truthfully. "Not many
men get kicked in the head by a horse and escape without
a fractured skull."</p>

<p>"That isn't it," he said; "you see for the last week
I've been wearing that steel helmet&mdash;that cast-iron sombrero
that weighs so much it almost breaks your neck,
and two minutes before that long-legged baby kicked
me, the tin hat fell off my head."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>By the time our battery had been loaded, another
battery was waiting to move on to the platform. Our
captain went down the length of the train examining
the halter straps in the horse cars and assuring himself
of the correct apportionment of men in each car. Then
we moved out on what developed to be a wild night ride.</p>

<p>The horse has been described as man's friend and
no one questions that a horse and a man, if placed out
in any large open space, are capable of getting along to
their mutual comfort. But when army regulations and
the requirements of military transportation place eight
horses and four men in the same toy French box car
and then pat all twelve of them figuratively on the neck
and tell them to lie down together and sleep through
an indefinite night's ride, it is not only probable, but it
is certain, that the legendary comradeship of the man
and the horse ceases. The described condition does not
encompass the best understood relation of the two as
travelling companions.</p>

<p>On our military trains in France, the reservations of
space for the human and dumb occupants of the same
car were something as follows: Four horses occupied
the forward half of the car. Four more horses occupied
the rear half of the car. Four men occupied the
remaining space. The eight four-footed animals are
packed in lengthwise with their heads towards the central
space between the two side doors. The central
space is reserved for the four two-footed animals.</p>

<p>Then the train moves. If the movement is forward
and sudden, as it usually is, the four horses in the forward
end of the car involuntarily obey the rules of inertia
and slide into the central space. If the movement
of the train is backward and equally sudden, the four
horses in the rear end of the car obey the same rule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and plunge forward into the central space. On the
whole, night life for the men in the straw on the floor
of the central space is a lively existence, while "riding
the rattlers with a horse outfit."</p>

<p>Our battery found it so. I rode a number of miles
that night sitting with four artillerymen in the central
space between the side doors which had been closed
upon orders. From the roof of the car, immediately
above our heads, an oil lantern swung and swayed with
every jolt of the wheels and cast a feeble light down
upon our conference in the straw. We occupied a small
square area which we had attempted to particularise by
roping it off.</p>

<p>On either side were the blank surfaces of the closed
doors. To either end were the heads of four nervous
animals, eight ponderous hulks of steel-shod horseflesh,
high strung and fidgety, verging almost on panic under
the unusual conditions they were enduring, and subject
at any minute to new fits of excitement.</p>

<p>We sat at their feet as we rattled along. I recalled
the scene of the loose cannon plunging about the crowded
deck of a rolling vessel at sea and related Hugo's thrilling
description to my companions.</p>

<p>"Yeah," observed Shoemaker, driver of the "wheelers"
on No. 4 piece, "Yeah, but there ain't no mast to climb
up on and get out of the way on in this here boxcar."</p>

<p>"I'd rather take my chances with a cannon any day,"
said 'Beady' Watson, gunner. "A cannon will stay put
when you fix it. There's our piece out on the flat car
and she's all lashed and blocked. It would take a wreck
to budge her off that flat. I wish the B. C. had let me
ride with the old gun out there. It would be a little
colder but a lot healthier. Try to go to sleep in here
and you'll wake up with a horse sitting on you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where do you suppose we are going anyway?" asked
Slater, fuse cutter in the same section. "I'm strong for
travel, but I always like to read the program before we
start to ramble. For all we know we might be on our
way to Switzerland or Italy or Spain or Egypt or somewhere."</p>

<p>"Why don't you go up and ask the Captain?" suggested
Boyle, corporal in charge of the car. "Maybe the
Colonel gave him a special message to deliver to you
about our dusty-nation. You needn't worry though.
They ain't going to bowl us out of France for some time
yet."</p>

<p>"Well, if we're just joy-riding around France," replied
Slater, "I hope we stop over to feed the horses
at Monte Carlo. I've heard a lot about that joint. They
say that they run the biggest crap game in the world
there, and the police lay off the place because the Governor
of the State or the King or something, banks the
game. They tell me he uses straight bones and I figure
a man could clean up big if he hit the game on a payday."</p>

<p>"Listen, kid, you've got this tip wrong," said Shoemaker.
"If there's anything happens to start a riot
among these horses, you are going to find that you're
gambling with death. And if we ever get off this train,
I think we have a date with Kaiser Bill."</p>

<p>"I've got a cousin somewhere in the German army.
He spells his 'Shoemaker' with a 'u.' My dad told me
that my grandfather and this cousin's grandfather had
a business disagreement over a sauerkraut factory some
time before the Civil War and my grandfather left
Germany. Since then, there ain't been no love lost
between the branches of the family, but we did hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
that Cousin Hans had left the sauerkraut business and
was packing a howitzer for the Kaiser."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope we come across him for your sake,"
said Watson. "It's kinda tough luck to get cheated out
of a big business like that, but then you must remember
that if your cousin's grandfather hadn't pulled the
dirty on your grandfather, your grandfather might never
have gone to America and most likely you'd still be
a German."</p>

<p>"I guess there's some sense in that, too," replied Shoemaker;
"wouldn't that been hell if I'd been on the other
side in this war? But anyhow, I do hope we run into
Cousin Hans somewhere."</p>

<p>The horses had been comparatively quiet for some
time, but now they seemed to be growing restless. They
pricked their ears and we knew something was bothering
them. The discussion stopped so that we could listen
better.</p>

<p>Above the rattle of the train, there came to us the
sound of firing. It seemed to come from the direction
in which we were going. With surprising quickness,
the explosions grew louder. We were not only speeding
toward the sounds of conflict, but the conflict itself
seemed to be speeding toward us.</p>

<p>Then came a crash unmistakably near. One of the
horses in the forward end reared, and his head thumped
the roof of the car. Once again on four feet, he pranced
nervously and tossed his blood-wet forelock. Immediately
the other horses began stamping.</p>

<p>Another crash!&mdash;this time almost directly overhead.
In the light of the swinging lantern, I could see the
terror in the eyes of the frightened brutes. We clung
to their halters and tried to quiet them but they lifted
us off our feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Put a twitch on that one's nose and hold him down,"
Boyle ordered.</p>

<p>"Gosh," said Slater, obeying, "we must be right up
on the front line. Hope they don't stop this train in
No Man's Land. Hold still, you crazy b&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cousin Hans must have heard you talking," Watson
shouted to Shoemaker. "Maybe you're going to see
him quicker than you expected."</p>

<p>The train was slowing down. The brakes shrieked
and grated as we came to a jerky stop. Three of us
braced ourselves at the heads of the four horses in the
rear of the car and prevented them from sliding on top
of us. Boyle and Slater were doing their best to quiet
the forward four. The explosions overhead increased.
Now we heard the report of field pieces so close that
they seemed to be almost alongside the track.</p>

<p>There came a sharp bang at one of the side doors,
and I thought I recognised the sound of the lead-loaded
handle of the captain's riding whip. His voice, coming
to us a minute later above the trampling and kicking of
the panic-stricken animals, verified my belief.</p>

<p>"Darken that lantern," he shouted. "Keep all lights
out and keep your helmets on. Stay in the cars and
hang on to the horses. There is an air raid on right
above us."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Boyle, and we heard the captain
run to the next car. I blew out the light and we were
in complete darkness, with eight tossing, plunging horses
that kicked and reared at every crash of the guns nearby
or burst of the shells overhead.</p>

<p>We hung on while the air battle went on above. One
horse went down on his knees and in his frantic struggles
to regain his feet, almost kicked the feet from under
the animal beside him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>At times, thunderous detonations told us that aerial
bombs were doing their work near at hand. We supposed
correctly that we were near some town not far
behind the lines, and that the German was paying it a
night visit with some of his heaviest visiting cards.</p>

<p>I opened one side door just a crack and looked out.
The darkness above blossomed with blinding blotches
of fire that flashed on and off. It seemed as though the
sky were a canopy of black velvet perforated with
hundreds of holes behind which dazzling lights passed
back and forth, flashing momentary gleams of brilliance
through the punctures. Again, this vision would pass as
a luminous dripping mass would poise itself on high and
cast a steady white glare that revealed clusters of grey
smoke puffs of exploded shrapnel.</p>

<p>We had to close the door because the flashes added to
the terror of the horses, but the aerial activity passed
almost as suddenly as it had come and left our train untouched.
As the raiding planes went down the wind,
followed always by the poppings of the anti-aircraft
guns, the sound of the conflict grew distant. We got
control over the horses although they still trembled with
fright.</p>

<p>There came another rap at the door and I hurriedly
accepted the captain's invitation to accompany him forward
to a first-class coach where I spent the remainder
of the night stretched out on the cushions. As our train
resumed its way into the darkness, I dreamed of racing
before a stampede of wild horses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>INTO THE LINE&mdash;THE FIRST AMERICAN SHOT IN THE WAR</h3>


<p>A damp, chill, morning mist made the dawn even
greyer as our battery train slid into a loading platform
almost under the walls of a large manufacturing plant
engaged in producing war materials.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that the section chiefs reported
that not a man had been injured, and not so much as a
leg broken in the crowded horse cars, every man in the
battery now declared the absence of any doubt but the
air raid had been directly aimed at Battery A.</p>

<p>"There might be a spy in this here very outfit," said
'Texas' Tinsdale, the battery alarmist. "Else how could
them German aviators have known that Battery A was
on the road last night? They knew we was on the way
to the front and they tried to get us."</p>

<p>"Hire a hall," shouted the gruffy top sergeant. "We've
got two hours to unload. A lot of you fireside veterans
get busy. Gun crews get to work on the flats and drivers
unload horses. No chow until we're ready to move
out."</p>

<p>The sign on a station lamp-post told us the name of the
town. It was Jarville. But it jarred nothing in our
memories. None of us had ever heard of it before.
I asked the captain where we were.</p>

<p>"Just about thirty miles behind the front," he replied.
"We are moving up to our last billets as soon as we unload
and feed."</p>

<p>The horses had made the ride wearing their harness,
some of which had become entangled and broken in transit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
A number of saddles had slipped from backs and
were down behind forelegs.</p>

<p>"We're learning something every minute," the captain
exclaimed. "American army regulations call for
the removal of all harness from the horses before they
are put into the cars, but the French have learned that
that is a dangerous practice over here.</p>

<p>"You can't unload unharnessed horses and get them
hitched to the guns as quick as you can harnessed horses.
The idea is this. We're pretty close behind the lines.
A German air party might make this unloading platform
a visit at any time and if any of them are in the air
and happen to see us unloading, they'd sure call on us.</p>

<p>"The French have learned that the only way to make
the best of such a situation, if it should arise, is to have
the horses already harnessed so that they can be run
out of the cars quickly, hitched to the guns in a jiffy and
hurried away. If the horses are in the cars unharnessed,
and all of the harness is being carried in other cars, confusion
is increased and there is a greater prospect of
your losing your train, horses, guns and everything from
an incendiary bomb, not to mention low flying machine
work."</p>

<p>His explanation revealed a promising attitude that I
found in almost all American soldiers of all ranks that
I had encountered up to that time in France. The foundation
of the attitude was a willingness to admit ignorance
of new conditions and an eagerness to possess
themselves of all knowledge that the French and British
had acquired through bitter and costly experience.</p>

<p>Further than that, the American inclination pushed
the soldier students to look beyond even those then accepted
standards. The tendency was to improve beyond
the French and British, to apply new American principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of time or labour-saving to simple operation, to
save man-power and horseflesh by sane safety appliances,
to increase efficiency, speed, accuracy&mdash;in a word,
their aim was to make themselves the best fighting men
in the Allied cause.</p>

<p>One instance of this is worthy of recounting. I came
upon the young Russian who was the battery saddler.
He was a citizen of the United States whose uniform
he wore, but he was such a new citizen, that he hardly
spoke English. I found him handling a small piece of
galvanised iron and a horse shoe. He appeared to be
trying to fit the rumpled piece of metal into the shoe.</p>

<p>In his broken English he explained that he was trying
to fashion a light metal plate that could be easily placed
between a horse's shoe and the hoof, to protect the frog
of the foot from nails picked up on the road. With all
soldiers wearing hobnailed boots, the roads were full of
those sharp bits of metal which had caused serious losses
of horseflesh through lameness and blood poisoning.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The unloading had continued under the eyes of smiling
French girls in bloomers who were just departing
from their work on the early morning shift in the munition
factory beside the station. These were the first
American soldiers they had seen and they were free to
pass comment upon our appearance. So were the men
of Battery A, who overlooked the oiled, grimed faces
and hands of the bloomered beauties, and announced the
general verdict that "they sure were fat little devils."</p>

<p>The unloading completed, a scanty snack consisting of
two unbuttered slices of white bread with a hunk of cold
meat and maybe the bite of an onion, had been put away
by the time the horses' nose bags were empty. With a
French guide in the lead, we moved off the platform,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
rattled along under a railroad viaduct, and down the
main street of Jarville, which was large enough to boast
street car tracks and a shell-damaged cathedral spire.</p>

<p>The remaining townsfolk had lived with the glare and
rumble of the front for three years now and the passage
back and forth of men and horses and guns hardly
elicited as much attention as the occasional promenade of
a policeman in Evanston, Illinois. But these were different
men that rode through those streets that day.</p>

<p>This was the first battery of American artillery that
had passed that way. This was an occasion and the
townspeople responded to it. Children, women and old
men chirped "vivas," kissed hands, bared heads and
waved hats and aprons from curb and shop door and
windows overhead.</p>

<p>There was no cheering, but there were smiles and tears
and "God bless you's." It was not a vociferous greeting,
but a heart-felt one. They offered all there was
left of an emotion that still ran deep and strong within
but that outwardly had been benumbed by three years
of nerve-rack and war-weariness.</p>

<p>Onward into the zone of war we rode. On through
successive battered villages, past houses without roofs,
windows with shattered panes, stone walls with gaping
shell holes through them, churches without steeples, our
battery moved toward the last billeting place before entering
the line.</p>

<p>This was the ancient town of Saint-Nicolas-du-Port on
the banks of the river Meurthe. Into the Place de la
Republic of the town the battery swung with a clamorous
advance guard of schoolchildren and street gamins.</p>

<p>The top sergeant who had preceded the battery into
the town, galloped up to the captain upon our entry
and presented him with a sheaf of yellow paper slips,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
which bore the addresses of houses and barns and the
complements of men and horses to be quartered in each.
This was the billeting schedule provided by the French
major of the town. The guns were parked, the horses
picketed and the potato peelers started on their endless
task. The absence of fuel for the mess fires demanded
immediate correction.</p>

<p>It was a few minutes past noon when the captain and
I entered the office of the French Town Major. It
was vacant. The officers were at <i>déjeuner</i>, we learned
from an old woman who was sweeping the commandant's
rooms. Where?&mdash;Ah, she knew not. We accosted
the first French officer we met on the street.</p>

<p>"Where does the Town Major eat?" the Captain inquired
in his best Indianapolis French. After the customary
exchange of salutes, introductions, handshakes
and greetings, the Frenchman informed us that Monsieur
Le Commandant favoured the <i>pommard</i>, that Madame
Larue served at the Hôtel de la Fountaine.</p>

<p>We hurried to that place, and there in a little back
room behind a plate-cluttered table with a red and white
checkered table cloth, we found the Major. The Major
said he spoke the English with the fluency. He demonstrated
his delusion when we asked for wood.</p>

<p>"Wood! Ah, but it is impossible that it is wood you
ask of me. Have I not this morning early seen with
my own eyes the wood ordered?"</p>

<p>"But there is no wood," replied the Captain. "I must
have wood for the fires. It is past noon and my men
have not eaten."</p>

<p>"Ah, but I am telling you there is wood," replied the
Major. "I saw your supply officer pay for the wood.
By now I believe it has been delivered for you in the
Place de la République."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"But it hasn't," remonstrated the Captain, "and the
fires have not yet been started, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it is on the way, probably," said the Major.
"Maybe it will be there soon. Maybe it is there now."</p>

<p>The Captain took another tack.</p>

<p>"Where was the wood bought?" he asked.</p>

<p>"From the wood merchant beyond the river," replied
the Major. "But it is already on the way, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you go to the wood merchant?" insisted the
Captain. "We have got to have the wood toot sweet."</p>

<p>"Ah! <i>tout de suite</i>&mdash;<i>tout de suite</i>&mdash;<i>tout de suite</i>," repeated
the Major in tones of exasperation. "With you
Americans it is always <i>tout de suite</i>. Here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He took my notebook and drew a plan of streets indicating
the way to the place of the wood merchant. In
spite of his remark and the undesired intrusion of business
upon his <i>déjeuner</i>, the Major's manner was as
friendly as could be expected from a Town Major. We
left on the run.</p>

<p>The wood merchant was a big man, elderly and fat.
His face was red and he had bushy grey eyebrows. He
wore a smock of blue cloth that came to his knees. He
remonstrated that it was useless for us to buy wood from
him because wood had already been bought for us. He
spoke only French. The Captain dismissed all further
argument by a direct frontal attack on the subject.</p>

<p>"<i>Avez-vous de bois?</i>" asked the Captain.</p>

<p>"<i>Oui</i>," the merchant nodded.</p>

<p>"<i>Avez-vous de chevaux?</i>" the Captain asked.</p>

<p>"<i>Oui</i>," the merchant nodded again.</p>

<p>"<i>Avez-vous de voiture?</i>" the Captain asked.</p>

<p>"<i>Oui</i>,"&mdash;another nod.</p>

<p>"All right then," continued the Captain, and then
emphasising each word by the sudden production of another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
stiff finger on his extended hand, he said, "<i>Du bois&mdash;des
chevaux&mdash;une voiture</i>&mdash;de whole damn business&mdash;and
toot sweet."</p>

<p>In some remarkable fashion the kindly wood merchant
gathered that the Captain wanted wood piled in a wagon,
drawn by a horse and wanted it in a hurry. <i>Tout de
suite</i>, pronounced "toot sweet" by our soldiers, was a
term calling for speed, that was among the first acquired
by our men in France.</p>

<p>The old man shrugged his shoulders, elevated his
hand, palm outward, and signified with an expression
of his face that it was useless to argue further for the
benefit of these Americans. He turned and gave the
necessary loading orders to his working force.</p>

<p>That working force consisted of two French girls,
each about eighteen years of age. They wore long baggy
bloomers of brown corduroy, tight at the ankles where
they flopped about in folds over clumsy wooden shoes.
They wore blouses of the same material and tam o'shanter
hats to match, called <i>bérets</i>.</p>

<p>Each one of them had a cigarette hanging from the
corner of her mouth. One stood on the ground and
tossed up the thirty or forty-pound logs to her sister
who stood above on top of the wagon. The latter caught
them in her extended arms and placed them in a pile.
To the best of my recollection, neither one of the girls
missed a puff.</p>

<p>While the loading proceeded, the wood merchant,
speaking slowly in French, made us understand the following:</p>

<p>"Many peculiar things happen in the war, Monsieur,"
he said. "Your country, the America, is the land of
wonders. Listen, my name is Helois. Ten days ago
there came to me one of the washerwomen who clean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the clothes on the banks of the Meurthe, and she said
to me:</p>

<p>"'Ah, Monsieur, the wood merchant. You are the
sly fox. I have your secret.' And I say to her that I
know not of what she speaks.</p>

<p>"'You boast in the town that your two sons are at
the front,' she said, 'but I know that one at least of
them is not.' And I was dumbfounded. I say to her,
'Woman, it is a lie you tell me. Both of my boys are
with their regiments, in the trenches even now, if by
the grace of the good God they still live.'</p>

<p>"'No,' she say to me, 'one of your sons hides in the
hotel of Madame Larue. How do I know this secret,
Monsieur the wood merchant? I know because this day
have I washed the shirt, with his name on it, at the river
bank. His name, Helois,&mdash;the Lieutenant Helois&mdash;was
stamped on the collar and the shirt came from the hotel,
La Fontaine.'</p>

<p>"I tell her that it is a mistake&mdash;that it is the great injustice
to me she speaks, and that night I dressed in my
best clothes to penetrate this mystery&mdash;to meet this man
who disgracefully used the name of my son&mdash;to expose
this impostor who would bring shame to the name of
Helois, the wood merchant, whose two sons have been
fighting for France these three long years.</p>

<p>"And so, Monsieur, I meet this man at the hotel. She
was right. His name was Helois. Here is his card.
The Lieutenant Louis F. Helois, and he is a lieutenant
in the United States Army."</p>

<p>"So it was a mistake," replied the Captain, handing
the card back to the wood merchant, whose lobster red
features bore an enigmatical smile.</p>

<p>"No,&mdash;not the mistake, the truth," replied the wood
merchant. "Not my son&mdash;but my grandson&mdash;the son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
my son&mdash;the son of my third son who went to America
years ago. And now he comes back in the uniform of
liberty to fight again for France. Ah, <i>Messieurs les
Officiers</i>&mdash;the sons of France return from the ends of
the world to fight her cause."</p>

<p>While the wood merchant was telling us that the
American grandson had only stopped three days in the
town and then had moved up to service at the front, the
air was shattered by a loud report. It was the snap of
the whip in the hands of the young French amazon,
standing high on the load of wood. We escorted the
fuel proudly to the Place de la République. Soon the
fires were burning briskly and the smell of onions and
coffee and hot chow was on the air.</p>

<p>The stoves were pitched at the bottom of a stone
monument in the centre of the square. Bags of potatoes
and onions and burlap covered quarters of beef and
other pieces of mess sergeants paraphernalia were piled
on the steps of the monument, which was covered with
the green and black scars from dampness and age.</p>

<p>The plinth supported a stone shaft fifteen feet in
height, which touched the lower branches of the trees.
The monument was topped with a huge cross of stone
on which was the sculptured figure of the Christ.</p>

<p>Little Sykoff, the battery mess sergeant, stood over
the stove at the bottom of the monument. He held in
his hand a frying pan, which he shook back and forth
over the fire to prevent the sizzling chips in the pan from
burning. His eyes lowered from an inspection of the
monument and met mine. He smiled.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gibbons," he said, "if that brother of mine, who
runs the photograph gallery out on Paulina and Madison
Streets in Chicago, could only see me now, he sure would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
tell the Rabbi. Can you beat it&mdash;a Jew here frying ham
in the shadow of the Cross."</p>

<p>It was rather hard to beat&mdash;and so was the ham. We
made this concession as we sat on the plinth of the
monument and polished our mess kits with bread. And
such bread&mdash;it was the regulation United States army
issue bread&mdash;white, firm and chuck full of nourishment&mdash;bread
that seemed like cake to the French youngsters
who tasted it and who returned with open mouths and
outstretched hands for more of the "good white bread."</p>

<p>After the meal, those members of Battery A not detailed
for immediate duty denied themselves none of the
joys that a new town, in a strange land, holds for a
soldier.</p>

<p>Saint-Nicolas-du-Port boasts a remarkable cathedral
of mediæval architecture, of enormous dimensions. It
was crumbling with age, but still housed the holy. Time
and the elements had left the traces of their rough usage
upon the edifice.</p>

<p>Half of the statues on the broad façade of the cathedral
had been broken, and now the niches afforded domiciles
for families of pigeons. On the ground, in a
careless pile, to one side of the frontal arch, was an ignominious
pile of miscellaneous arms and legs and heads
of sculptured figures, resting there in anything but saintly
dignity. Two of our young artillerymen were standing
in front of the cathedral surveying it.</p>

<p>"Certainly is in need of repairs," said one of them.
"I'll bet they haven't done no bricklaying or plumbing
on this place since before the Civil War."</p>

<p>"That ain't hardly the right way to treat old Saints,"
replied his companion, referring to the pile of broken
statuary. "Seems like they ought to cement the arms
and legs and heads back on those old boys and old girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and put them back on their pedestals. I guess, though,
there ain't nobody living to identify the pieces, so they
could get the right arms and heads on the right bodies."</p>

<p>Our battery had among its drivers an old timer who
might have been called a historian. His opinion held
weight in the organisation. He professed to be able
to read American ball scores and war news out of French
newspapers, a number of which he always carried. Later
that day, I heard him lecturing the cathedral critics on
their lack of appreciation of art and history.</p>

<p>"New things ain't art," he told them; "things has got
to be old before they are artistic. Nobody'd look at
the Venus dee Milo if she had all her arms on. You
never hear nobody admiring a modern up-to-date castle
with electric lighting and bath tubs in it. It simply
ain't art.</p>

<p>"Now, this cathedral is art. This country around
here is just full of history. Here's where whole book
stores of it was written. Why, say, there was batteries
of artillery rolling through this country a million years
ago. It was right around here that Napoleon joined
forces with Julius Cæsar to fight the Crusaders. This
here is sacred ground."</p>

<p>In the evening, a number of the battery, located the
<i>buvette</i> that carried across its curtained front the gold
lettered sign <i>bar Parisian</i>. It was a find. Some thirty
American artillerymen crowded around the tables.</p>

<p>Cigarette smoke filled the low-ceilinged room with
blue layers, through which the lamp light shone. In one
corner stood a mechanical piano which swallowed big
copper sous and gave out discord's metallic melody. It
was of an American make and the best number on its
printed programme was "Aren't you Coming Back to Old
Virginia, Molly?" Sous followed sous into this howitzer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of harmony and it knew no rest that night. Everybody
joined in and helped it out on the choruses.</p>

<p>Things were going fine when the door opened at about
nine thirty, and there stood two members of the American
Provost Guard. They carried with them two orders.
One instructed Madame, the proprietress, to dispense
no more red ink or beer to American soldiers that
night, and the other was a direction to all Americans
around the table to get back to their billets for the night.</p>

<p>The bunch left with reluctance but without a grumble.
It was warm and comfortable within the <i>bar Parisian</i>
and Madame's smiles and red wine and beer and Camembert
cheese composed the Broadway of many recent
dreams. But they left without complaint.</p>

<p>They made their rollicking departure, returning Madame's
parting smiles, gallantly lifting their steel helmets
and showering her with vociferous "bong swore's."
And&mdash;well it simply must be told. She kissed the last
one out out the door and, turning, wiped away a tear
with the corner of her apron. Madame had seen youth
on the way to the front before.</p>

<p>The billets were comfortable. Some were better than
others. Picket line details slept in their blankets in the
hay over the stables. Gun crews drew beds and pallets
on the floor in occupied houses. In these homes there
was always that hour before retirement for the night
when the old men and remaining women of the French
household and their several military guests billeted in
the place, would gather about the fireplace in the kitchen
and regale one another with stories, recounted by the
murder of French and English languages and a wealth
of pantomime.</p>

<p>Louise, the eighteen-year-old daughter of the town-crier&mdash;he
who daily beat the drum in front of the Hôtel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
de Ville and read lengthy bulletins, was interested in the
workings of Gunner Black's colt automatic. Gunner
Black, most anxious to show her, demonstrated the action
of the pistol but, forgetting that inevitable shell
in the chamber, shot himself in the arm.</p>

<p>It was only an incident. The noise scared Louise,
but not the wound. She had seen too many Americans
get shot in the moving pictures.</p>

<p>The captain and I were quartered in the house of the
Curé of the cathedral. The old housekeeper of the
place made the captain blush when she remarked her surprise
that there were such young captains in the American
army. Her name was Madame Dupont, and she
was more than pleased to learn from the captain that
that had been the maiden name of his mother.</p>

<p>The captain's room had the interior dimensions and
heavy decorations of the mystic inner sanctum of some
secret grand lodge. Religious paintings and symbols
hung from the walls, which were papered in dark red to
match the heavy plush hangings over the ever closed
windows.</p>

<p>Two doors in the blank wall swung open revealing a
hermetically sealed recess in which a bed just fitted.
This arrangement, quite common in France, indicated
that the device now popular in two-room sleeping apartments
in America, must have been suggested by the sleeping
customs of mediæval times.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, our battery pulled out for the
front. We were bound for the line. We took the roads
out of Saint Nicolas to the east, making our way toward
that part of the front that was known as the Luneville
sector. Our way lay through the towns of Dombasle,
Sommerviller, Maixe, Einville, Valhey, Serres, to the
remains of the ruined village of Hoeville.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>The sector runs almost along the border between
France and old Lorraine, occupied by the Germans since
1870. Even the names of the old French towns beyond
the border had been changed to German in the effort of
the Prussians to Germanise the stolen province.</p>

<p>It was in this section during the few days just prior
to the outbreak of the war that France made unwise
demonstration of her disinclination toward hostilities
with Germany. Every soldier in France was under arms,
as was every soldier in Europe. France had military
patrols along her borders. In the French chamber of
deputies, the socialists had rushed through a measure
which was calculated to convince the German people that
France had no intentions or desire of menacing German
territory. By that measure every French soldier was
withdrawn from the Franco-German border to a line
ten miles inside of France. The German appreciation
of this evidence of peacefulness was manifested when
the enemy, at the outbreak of the war, moved across the
border and occupied that ten-mile strip of France.</p>

<p>France had succeeded in driving the enemy back again
in that part of Lorraine, but only at the cost of many
lives and the destruction of many French towns and
villages. Since the close of the fighting season of 1914,
there had been little or no progress on either side at
this point. The opposing lines here had been stationary
for almost three years and it was known on both sides
as a quiet sector.</p>

<p>The country side was of a rolling character, but very
damp. At that season of the year when our first American
fighting men reached the Western front, that part
of the line that they occupied was particularly muddy
and miserable.</p>

<p>Before nine o'clock that morning as we rode on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the front, the horse-drawn traffic, including our battery,
was forced to take the side of the road numerous times
to permit the passage of long trains of motor trucks
loaded down with American infantrymen, bound in the
same direction.</p>

<p>Most of the motor vehicles were of the omnibus type.
A number of them were worthy old double-deckers that
had seen long years of peaceful service on the boulevards
of Paris before the war. Slats of wood ran lengthwise
across the windows of the lower seating compartment
and through these apertures young, sun-burned, American
faces topped with steel helmets, peered forth.</p>

<p>Some of our men reposed languidly on the rear steps
of the busses or on the tops. Most of the bus-loads were
singing rollicking choruses. The men were in good
spirits. They had been cheered in every village they
had passed through on the way from their training area.</p>

<p>"Howdy, bowleg," was the greeting shouted by one
of these motoring mockers, who looked down on our
saddled steeds, "better get a hustle on them hayburners.
We're going to be in Berlin by the time you get where
the front used to be."</p>

<p>"Yes, you will," replied one of the mounted artillerymen,
with a negative inflection. "You'll get a hell of
a long ways without us. If you doughboys start anything
without the artillery, you'll see Berlin through the
bars of a prisoner's cage."</p>

<p>"Lucky pups&mdash;the artillery&mdash;nothing to do but ride,"
was the passing shout of another taunter, perched high
on a bus. This was an unanswerable revision of an old
taunt that the artillery used to shout to passing infantry
in the days when a foot soldier was really a foot soldier.
Then the easy-riding mounted troops, when passing an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
infantry column on the road, would say, "Pretty soft
for the doughboys&mdash;nothing to do but walk."</p>

<p>"Times certainly have changed," one of our battery
drivers felt it necessary to remark to me in defence of
his branch of the service. "But there ain't no spark
plugs or carburetors to get out of order on our mounts.</p>

<p>"However, we do have our troubles. That runaway
wheeler in No. 2 section broke away from the picket
line last night and Kemball and I were detailed to hunt
all over town for him.</p>

<p>"You know that dark, winding, narrow street, that
winds down the hill back of the cathedral. Well, it
was about midnight and blacker than the ace of spades,
when Kemball and I pushed along there in the dark,
looking for that onery animal.</p>

<p>"Suddenly, we heard a sharp clatter on the cobblestones
half a block up the hill. It was coming our way
full speed. 'Here he comes now,' said Kemball, 'and
he's galloping like hell. Jump into a doorway or he'll
climb all over us.'</p>

<p>"We waited there pressed against the wall in the dark
as the galloping came up to us and passed. What dy'e
s'pose it was? It wasn't that runaway horse at all. Just
a couple of them French kids chasing one another in
wooden shoes."</p>

<p>The road to the front was a populous one. We passed
numerous groups of supply wagons carrying food and
fodder up to the front lines. Other wagons were returning
empty and here and there came an ambulance
with bulgy blankets outlining the figures of stretcher
cases, piled two high and two wide. Occasionally a
Y. M. C. A. runabout loaded down with coffee pots and
candy tins and driven by helmeted wearers of the Red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Triangle, would pass us carrying its store of extras to
the boys up front.</p>

<p>We passed through villages where manufacturing
plants were still in operation and, nearer the front, the
roads lay through smaller hamlets, shell torn and deserted,
save for sentries who stood guard in wooden
coops at intersections. Civilians became fewer and
fewer, although there was not a village that did not have
one or two women or children or old men unfit for uniform.</p>

<p>Finally the road mounted a rolling hill and here it
was bordered by roadside screens consisting of stretched
chicken wire to which whisps of straw and grass and bits
of green dyed cloth had been attached. Our men riding
behind the screen peered through apertures in it and saw
the distant hills forward, from which German glasses
could have observed all passage along that road had it
not been for the screen.</p>

<p>So we moved into position. It was late in the night
of October 22nd, 1917, that our batteries of artillery
and companies of infantry moved through the darkness
on the last lap of their trip to the front. The roads
were sticky and gummy. A light rain was falling. The
guns boomed in front of us, but not with any continued
intensity. Through streets paved with slippery cobbles
and bordered with the bare skeletons of shell-wrecked
houses, our American squads marched four abreast.
Their passing in the darkness was accompanied by the
sound of the unhastened tread of many hobnailed boots.</p>

<p>At times, the rays of a cautiously flashed electric light
would reveal our infantrymen with packs on back and
rifles slung over their shoulders. A stiff wind whipped
the rain into their faces and tugged the bottoms of their
flapping, wet overcoats.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that they had made it on
foot a number of miles from the place where they had
disembarked from the motor trucks, the men marched
along to the soft singing of songs, which were ordered
discontinued as the marching columns got closer to the
communicating trenches which led into the front line.</p>

<p>In the march were machine gun carts hauled by American
mules and rolling kitchens, which at times dropped
on the darkened road swirls of glowing red embers that
had to be hurriedly stamped out. Anxious American
staff officers consulted their wrist watches frequently
in evidence of the concern they felt as to whether the
various moving units were reaching designated points
upon the scheduled minute.</p>

<p>It was after midnight that our men reached the front
line. It was the morning of October 23rd, 1917, that
American infantrymen and Bavarian regiments of
<i>Landwehr</i> and <i>Landsturm</i> faced one another for the
first time in front line positions on the European front.</p>

<p>Less than eight hundred yards of slate and drab-coloured
soft ground, blotched with rust-red expanses of
wire entanglements, separated the hostile lines.</p>

<p>There was no moon. A few cloud-veiled stars only
seemed to accentuate the blackness of the night. There,
in the darkness and the mud, on the slippery firing step
of trench walls and in damp, foul-smelling dugouts,
young red-blooded Americans tingled for the first time
with the thrill that they had trained so long and travelled
so far to experience.</p>

<p>Through unfortunate management of the Press arrangements
in connection with this great historical event,
American correspondents accredited by the War Department
to our forces, were prevented from accompanying
our men into the front that night. Good fortune, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
favoured me as one of the two sole exceptions to
this circumstance. Raymond G. Carroll, correspondent
of the Philadelphia <i>Public Ledger</i>, and myself, representing
the Chicago <i>Tribune</i> and its associated papers,
were the only two newspaper men who went into the
line with the men that night. For enjoying this unusual
opportunity, we were both arrested several days later,
not, however, until after we had obtained the first-hand
story of the great event.</p>

<p>A mean drizzle of rain was falling that night, but it
felt cool on the pink American cheeks that were hot with
excitement. The very wetness of the air impregnated
all it touched with the momentousness of the hour.
Spirits were high and the mud was deep, but we who
were there had the feeling that history was chiselling that
night's date into her book of ages.</p>

<p>Occasionally a shell wheezed over through the soggy
atmosphere, seeming to leave an unseen arc in the darkness
above. It would terminate with a sullen thump in
some spongy, water-soaked mound behind us. Then an
answering missive of steel would whine away into the
populated invisibility in front of us.</p>

<p>French comrades, in half English and half French,
gushed their congratulations, and shook us by the hand.
Some of us were even hugged and kissed on both cheeks.
Our men took the places of French platoons that were
sent back to rest billets. But other French platoons
remained shoulder to shoulder with our men in the front
line. The presence of our troops there was in continuation
of their training for the purpose of providing a
nucleus for the construction of later contingents. Both
our infantry and our artillery acted in conjunction with
the French infantry and artillery and the sector remained
under French command.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Our men were eager to ask questions and the French
were ever ready to respond. They first told us about
the difference in the sound of shells. Now that one that
started with a bark in back of us and whined over our
heads is a <i>départ</i>. It is an Allied shell on its way to the
Germans. Now, this one, that whines over first and
ends with a distant grunt, like a strong wallop on a
wet carpet, is an <i>arrivée</i>. It has arrived from Germany.
In the dugouts, our men smoked dozens of cigarettes,
lighting fresh ones from the half-consumed butts. It is
the appetite that comes with the progressive realisation
of a long deferred hope. It is the tension that comes
from at last arriving at an object and then finding nothing
to do, now that you are there. It is the nervousness
that nerveless youth suffers in inactivity.</p>

<p>The men sloshed back and forth through the mud
along the narrow confines of the trench. The order is
against much movement, but immobility is unbearable.
Wet slickers rustle against one another in the narrow
traverses, and equipment, principally the French and
English gas masks, hanging at either hip become entangled
in the darkness.</p>

<p>At times a steel helmet falls from some unaccustomed
head and, hitting perhaps a projecting rock in the trench
wall, gives forth a clang which is followed by curses
from its clumsy owner and an admonition of quiet from
some young lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Olson, keep your damn fool head down below the
top of that trench or you'll get it blown off." The sergeant
is talking, and Olson, who brought from Minnesota
a keen desire to see No Man's Land even at the risk
of his life, is forced to repress the yearning.</p>

<p>"Two men over in B Company just got holes drilled
through their beans for doing the same thing," continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the sergeant. "There's nothing you can see out
there anyhow. It's all darkness."</p>

<p>Either consciously or unconsciously, the sergeant was
lying, for the purpose of saving Olson and others from
a fool's fate. There was not a single casualty in any
American unit on the line that first night.</p>

<p>"Where is the telephone dugout?" a young lieutenant
asked his French colleague. "I want to speak to the
battalion commander."</p>

<p>"But you must not speak English over the telephone,"
replied the Frenchman, "the Germans will hear you with
the instruments they use to tap the underground circuit."</p>

<p>"But I was going to use our American code," said the
front line novice; "if the Germans tap in they won't be
able to figure out what it means."</p>

<p>"Ah, no, my friend," replied the Frenchman, smiling.
"They won't know what the message means, but your
voice and language will mean to them that Americans
are occupying the sector in front of them, and we want
to give them that information in another way, <i>n'est ce
pas?</i>"</p>

<p>Undoubtedly there was some concern in the German
trenches just over the way with regard to what was
taking place in our lines. Relief periods are ticklish
intervals for the side making them. It is quite possible
that some intimation of our presence may have been
given.</p>

<p>There was considerable conversation and movement
among our men that night. Jimmy found it frequently
necessary to call the attention of Johnny to some new
thing he had discovered. And of a consequence, much
natural, but needless, chattering resulted.</p>

<p>I believe the Germans did become nervous because they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
made repeated attacks on the enveloping darkness with
numbers of star shells. These aerial beauties of night
warfare released from their exploding encasements high
in the air, hung from white silk parachutes above the
American amateurs.</p>

<p>The numerous company and battery jesters did not
refrain from imitative expressions of "Ahs" and "Ohs"
and "Ain't it bootiful?" as their laughing upturned faces
were illuminated in the white light.</p>

<p>That night one rocket went up shortly before morning.
It had a different effect from its predecessors. It
reared itself from the darkness somewhere on the left.
Its flight was noiseless as it mounted higher and higher
on its fiery staff. Then it burst in a shower of green
balls of fire.</p>

<p>That meant business. One green rocket was the signal
that the Germans were sending over gas shells. It was
an alarm that meant the donning of gas masks. On they
went quickly. It was the first time this equipment had
been adjusted under emergency conditions, yet the men
appeared to have mastered the contrivances.</p>

<p>Then the word was passed along the trenches and
through the dugouts for the removal of the masks. It
had not been a French signal. The green rocket had
been sent up by the Germans. The enemy was using
green rockets that night as a signal of their own. There
had been no gas shells. It was a false alarm.</p>

<p>"The best kind of practice in the world," said one of
our battalion commanders; "it's just the stuff we're here
for. I hope the Germans happen to do that every night
a new bunch of our men get in these trenches."</p>

<p>While the infantry were experiencing these initial
thrills in the front line, our gunners were struggling in
the mud of the black gun pits to get their pieces into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
position in the quickest possible time, and achieve the
honour of firing that first American shot in the war.</p>

<p>Each battery worked feverishly in intense competition
with every other battery. Battery A of the 6th Field,
to which I had attached myself, lost in the race for the
honour. Another battery in the same regiment accomplished
the achievement.</p>

<p>That was Battery C of the 6th Field Artillery. I am
reproducing, herewith, for what I believe is the first
time, the exact firing data on that shot and the officers
and men who took part in it.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>By almost superhuman work through the entire previous
day and night, details of men from Battery C had
pulled one cannon by ropes across a muddy, almost impassable,
meadow. So anxious were they to get off the
first shot that they did not stop for meals.</p>

<p>They managed to drag the piece into an old abandoned
French gun pit. The historical position of that gun was
one kilometre due east of the town of Bathelemont and
three hundred metres northeast of the Bauzemont-Bathelemont
road. The position was located two miles from
the old international boundary line between France and
German-Lorraine. The position was one and one-half
kilometres back of the French first line, then occupied
by Americans.</p>

<p>The first shot was fired at 6:5:10 A. M., October 23rd,
1917. Those who participated in the firing of the shot
were as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Lieutenant F. M. Mitchell, U.S.R., acted as platoon chief.<br />
Corporal Robert Braley laid the piece.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>Sergeant Elward Warthen loaded the piece.<br />
Sergeant Frank Grabowski prepared the fuse for cutting.<br />
Private Louis Varady prepared the fuse for cutting.<br />
Private John J. Wodarczak prepared the fuse for cutting.<br />
Corporal Osborne W. De Varila prepared the fuse for cutting.<br />
Sergeant Lonnie Domonick cut the fuse.<br />
Captain Idus R. McLendon gave the command to fire.<br />
Sergeant Alex L. Arch fired first shot.<br />
</p>

<p>The missile fired was a 75 millimetre or 3-inch high-explosive
shell. The target was a German battery of
150 millimetre or 6-inch guns located two kilometres back
of the German first line trenches, and one kilometre in
back of the boundary line between France and German-Lorraine.
The position of that enemy battery on the
map was in a field 100 metres west of the town which
the French still call Xanrey, but which the Germans have
called Schenris since they took it from France in 1870.
Near that spot&mdash;and damn near&mdash;fell the first American
shell fired in the great war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>: It is peculiar to note that I am writing this
chapter at Atlantic City, October 23rd, 1918, just one
year to the day after the event. That shot surely started
something.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE FIRST AMERICAN SECTOR</h3>


<p>It was in the Luneville sector, described in the preceding
chapter, that the first American fighting men
faced the Germans on the western front. It was there
that the enemy captured its first American prisoners
in a small midnight raid; it was there that we captured
some prisoners of theirs, and inflicted our first German
casualties; it was there that the first American fighting
man laid down his life on the western front.</p>

<p>In spite of these facts, however, the occupation of
those front line posts in that sector constituted nothing
more than a post-graduate course in training under the
capable direction of French instructors who advised our
officers and men in everything they did.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the course, which extended over
a number of weeks, the American forces engaged in it
were withdrawn from the line and retired for a well-earned
rest period and for reorganisation purposes in
areas back of the line. There they renewed equipment
and prepared for the occupation of the first all-American
sector on the western front.</p>

<p>That sector was located in Lorraine some distance to
the east of the Luneville front. It was north and slightly
west of the city of Toul. It was on the east side of the
St. Mihiel salient, then occupied by the Germans.</p>

<p>The sector occupied a position in what the French
called the Pont-à-Mousson front. Our men were to occupy
an eight-mile section of the front line trenches extending
from a point west of the town of Flirey, to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
point west of the ruins of the town of Seicheprey. The
position was not far from the French stronghold of
Verdun to the northwest or the German stronghold of
Metz to the northeast, and was equidistant from both.</p>

<p>That line changed from French blue to American
khaki on the night of January 21st. The sector became
American at midnight. I watched the men as they
marched into the line. In small squads they proceeded
silently up the road toward the north, from which direction
a raw wind brought occasional sounds resembling
the falling of steel plates on the wooden floor of a long
corridor.</p>

<p>A half moon doubly ringed by mist, made the hazy
night look grey. At intervals, phantom flashes flushed
the sky. The mud of the roadway formed a colourless
paste that made marching not unlike skating on a platter
of glue.</p>

<p>This was their departure for the front&mdash;this particular
battalion&mdash;the first battalion of the 16th United States
Infantry. I knew, and every man in it knew, what was
before them.</p>

<p>Each man was in for a long tour of duty in trenches
knee-deep with melted snow and mud. Each platoon
commander knew the particular portion of that battle-battered
bog into which he must lead his men. Each
company commander knew the section of shell-punctured,
swamp land that was his to hold, and the battalion
commander, a veteran American soldier, was well aware
of the particular perils of the position which his one
thousand or more men were going to occupy in the very
jaw-joint of a narrowing salient.</p>

<p>All branches of the United States military forces may
take special pride in that first battalion that went into
the new American line that night. The commander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
represented the U. S. Officers Reserve Corps, and the
other officers and men were from the reserves, the regulars,
West Point, the National Guard and the National
Army. Moreover, the organisation comprised men from
all parts of the United States as well as men whose parents
had come from almost every race and nationality
in the world. One company alone possessed such a
babble of dialects among its new Americans, that it
proudly called itself, the Foreign Legion.</p>

<p>For two days the battalion had rested in the mud of
the semi-destroyed village of Ansauville, several miles
back of the front. A broad, shallow stream, then at
the flood, wound through and over most of the village
site. Walking anywhere near the border of the water,
one pulled about with him pounds of tenacious, black
gumbo. Dogs and hogs, ducks and horses, and men,&mdash;all
were painted with nature's handiest camouflage.</p>

<p>Where the stream left the gaping ruins of a stone
house on the edge of the village, there was a well-kept
French graveyard, clinging to the slope of a small hill.
Above the ruins of the hamlet, stood the steeple of the
old stone church, from which it was customary to ring
the alarm when the Germans sent over their shells of
poison gas.</p>

<p>Our officers busied themselves with, unfinished supply
problems. Such matters as rubber boots for the men,
duck boards for the trenches, food for the mules, and
ration containers necessary for the conveyance of hot
food to the front lines, were not permitted to interfere
with the battalion's movements. In war, there is always
the alternative of doing without or doing with
makeshifts, and that particular battalion commander,
after three years of war, was the kind of a soldier who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
made the best of circumstances no matter how adverse
they may have been.</p>

<p>That commander was Major Griffiths. He was an
American fighting man. His military record began in
the Philippine Insurrection, when, as a sergeant in a
Tennessee regiment of National Guard, he was mentioned
in orders for conspicuous gallantry. At the suppression
of the insurrection, he became a major in the
United States Constabulary in the Philippines. He resigned
his majority in 1914, entered the Australian
forces, and was wounded with them in the bloody landing
at Gallipoli. He was invalided to England, where, upon
his partial recovery, he was promoted to major in the
British forces and was sent to France in command of a
battalion of the Sherwood Foresters. With them, he
received two more wounds, one at the Battle of Ypres,
and another during the fighting around Loos.</p>

<p>He was in an English hospital when America entered
the war, but he hurried his convalescence and obtained
a transfer back to the army of his own country. He
hadn't regained as yet the full use of his right hand, his
face still retained a hospital pallor, and an X-ray photograph
of his body revealed the presence of numerous
pieces of shell still lodged there. But on that night
of January 21st, he could not conceal the pride that he
felt in the honour in having been the one chosen to command
the battalion of Americans that was to take over
the first American sector in France. Major Griffiths
survived those strenuous days on the Pont-à-Mousson
front, but he received a fatal wound three months later
at the head of his battalion in front of Catigny, in
Picardy. He died fighting under his own flag.</p>

<p>Just before daylight failed that wintry day, three
poilus walked down the road from the front and into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Ansauville. Two of them were helping a third, whose
bandaged arm and shoulder explained the mission of
the party. As they passed the rolling kitchens where
the Americans were receiving their last meal before entering
the trenches, there was silence and not even an
exchange of greetings or smiles.</p>

<p>This lack of expression only indicated the depth of
feeling stirred by the appearance of this wounded French
soldier. The incident, although comparatively trivial,
seemed to arouse within our men a solemn grimness and
a more fervent determination to pay back the enemy
in kind. In silence, our men finished that last meal,
which consisted of cold corned beef, two slices of dry
bread per man, and coffee.</p>

<p>The sight of that one wounded man did not make our
boys realise more than they already did, what was in
front of them. They had already made a forty mile
march over frozen roads up to this place and had incurred
discomforts seemingly greater than a shell-shattered
arm or a bullet-fractured shoulder. After that
gruelling hiking experience, it was a pleasant prospect to
look forward to a chance of venting one's feelings on
the enemy.</p>

<p>At the same time, no chip-on-the-shoulder cockiness
marked the disposition of these men about to take first
grips with the Germans,&mdash;no challenging bravado was
revealed in the actions or statements of these grim,
serious trail-blazers of the American front, whose attitude
appeared to be one of soldierly resignation to the
first martial principle, "Orders is orders."</p>

<p>As the companies lined up in the village street in
full marching order, awaiting the command to move,
several half-hearted attempts at jocularity died cold.
One irrepressible made a futile attempt at frivolity by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
announcing that he had Cherokee blood in his veins and
was so tough he could "spit battleships." This attempted
jocularity drew as much mirth as an undertaker's final
invitation to the mourners to take the last, long look at
the departed.</p>

<p>One bright-faced youngster tingling with the thrill of
anticipation, leaped on a gun carriage and absently
whistled a shrill medley, beginning with "Yaka-hula,"
and ending with "Just a Song at Twilight." There was
food for thought in the progress of his efforts from the
frivolous to the pensive, but there was little time for such
thoughts. No one even told him to shut up.</p>

<p>While there was still light, an aerial battle took place
overhead. For fifteen minutes, the French anti-aircraft
guns banged away at three German planes, which were
audaciously sailing over our lines. The Americans
rooted like bleacherites for the guns but the home team
failed to score, and the Germans sailed serenely home.
They apparently had had time to make adequate observations.</p>

<p>During the entire afternoon, German sausage balloons
had hung high in the air back of the hostile line, offering
additional advantages for enemy observation. On the
highroad leading from Ansauville, a conspicuous sign
<i>L'enemie vous voit</i> informed newcomers that German
eyes were watching their movements and could interfere
at any time with a long range shell. The fact was
that the Germans held high ground and their glasses
could command almost all of the terrain back of our
lines.</p>

<p>Under this seemingly eternal espionage punctuated at
intervals by heavy shelling, several old women of the
village had remained in their homes, living above the
ground on quiet days and moving their knitting to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
front yard dugout at times when gas and shell and bomb
interfered. Some of these women operated small shops
in the front rooms of their damaged homes and the
Americans lined up in front of the window counters
and exchanged dirty French paper money for canned
<i>pâté de foi gras</i> or jars of mustard.</p>

<p>A machine gun company with mule-drawn carts led the
movement from Ansauville into the front. It was followed
at fifty yard intervals by other sections. Progress
down that road was executed in small groups&mdash;it was
better to lose one whole section than an entire company.</p>

<p>That highroad to the front, with its border of shell-withered
trees, was revealed that night against a bluish
grey horizon occasionally rimmed with red. Against
the sky, the moving groups were defined as impersonal
black blocks. Young lieutenants marched ahead of each
platoon. In the hazy light, it was difficult to distinguish
them. The only difference was that their hips seemed
bulkier from the heavy sacks, field glasses, map cases,
canteens, pistol holsters and cartridge clips.</p>

<p>Each section, as it marched out of the village, passed
under the eye of Major Griffiths, who sat on his horse
in the black shadow of a wall. A sergeant commanding
one section was coming toward him.</p>

<p>"Halt!" ordered the Major. "Sergeant, where is your
helmet?"</p>

<p>"One of the men in my section is wearing it, sir,"
replied the Sergeant.</p>

<p>"Why?" snapped the Major.</p>

<p>"Somebody took his and he hadn't any," said the
Sergeant, "so I made him wear mine, sir."</p>

<p>"Get it back and wear it yourself," the Major ordered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
"Nothing could hurt the head of a man who couldn't
hang on to his own helmet."</p>

<p>The order was obeyed, the section marched on and a
bareheaded Irishman out of hearing of the Major said,
"I told the Sergeant not to make me wear it; I don't
need the damn thing."</p>

<p>Another section passed forward, the moonlight gleaming
on the helmets jauntily cocked over one ear and
casting black shadows over the faces of the wearers.
From these shadows glowed red dots of fire.</p>

<p>"Drop those cigarettes," came the command from the
all watchful, unseen presence mounted on the horse in the
shadow of the wall. Automatically, the section spouted
red arcs that fell to the road on either side in a shower
of sparks.</p>

<p>"It's a damn shame to do that." Major Griffith spoke
to me standing beside his horse. "You can't see a
cigarette light fifty yards away, but if there were no
orders against smoking, the men would be lighting
matches or dumping pipes, and such flashes can be seen."</p>

<p>There was need for caution. The enemy was always
watchful for an interval when one organisation was relieving
another on the line. That period represented
the time when an attack could cause the greatest confusion
in the ranks of the defenders. But that night our
men accomplished the relief of the French Moroccan
division then in the line without incident.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Two nights later, in company with a party of correspondents,
I paid a midnight visit to our men in the
front line trenches of that first American sector. With
all lights out, cigarettes tabooed and the siren silenced,
our overloaded motor slushed slowly along the shell-pitted
roads, carefully skirting groups of marching men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
and lumbering supply wagons that took shape suddenly
out of the mist-laden road in front of us.</p>

<p>Although it was not raining, moisture seemed to drip
from everything, and vapours from the ground, mixing
with the fog overhead, almost obscured the hard-working
moon.</p>

<p>In the greyness of the night sight and smell lost their
keenness, and familiar objects assumed unnatural forms,
grotesque and indistinct.</p>

<p>From somewhere ahead dull, muffled thumps in the mist
brought memories of spring house cleaning and the dusting
out of old cushions, but it was really the three-year-old
song of the guns. Nature had censored observation
by covering the spectacle with the mantle of indefiniteness.
Still this was the big thing we had come to see&mdash;night
work in and behind the front lines of the American
sector.</p>

<p>We approached an engineers' dump, where the phantoms
of fog gradually materialised into helmeted khaki
figures that moved in mud knee-deep and carried boxes
and planks and bundles of tools. Total silence covered
all the activity and not a ray of light revealed what mysteries
had been worked here in surroundings that seemed
no part of this world.</p>

<p>An irregular pile of rock loomed grey and sinister
before us, and, looking upward, we judged, from its
gaping walls, that it was the remains of a church steeple.
It was the dominating ruin in the town of Beaumont.</p>

<p>"Turn here to the left," the officer conducting our party
whispered into the ear of the driver.</p>

<p>The sudden execution of the command caused the officer's
helmet to rasp against that of the driver with a
sound that set the cautious whispering to naught.</p>

<p>"Park here in the shadow," he continued. "Make no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
noise; show no light. They dropped shells here ten minutes
ago. Gentlemen, this is regimental headquarters.
Follow me."</p>

<p>In a well buttressed cellar, surmounted by a pile of
ruins, we found the colonel sitting at a wooden table in
front of a grandfather's clock of scratched mahogany.
He called the roll&mdash;five special correspondents, Captain
Chandler, American press officer, with a goatee and fur
coat to match; Captain Vielcastel, a French press officer,
who is a marquis and speaks English, and a lieutenant
from brigade headquarters, who already had been named
"Whispering Willie."</p>

<p>The colonel offered sticks to those with the cane habit.
With two runners in the lead, we started down what had
been the main street of the ruined village.</p>

<p>"I can't understand the dropping of that shell over
here to-night," the colonel said. "When we relieved the
French, there had been a long-standing agreement against
such discourtesy. It's hard to believe the Boche would
make a scrap of paper out of that agreement. They must
have had a new gunner on the piece. We sent back two
shells into their regimental headquarters. They have
been quiet since."</p>

<p>Ten minutes' walk through the mud, and the colonel
stopped to announce: "Within a hundred yards of you, a
number of men are working. Can you hear 'em?"</p>

<p>No one could, so he showed us a long line of sweating
Americans stretching off somewhere into the fog. Their
job was more of the endless trench digging and improving
behind the lines. While one party swung pick and
spade in the trenches, relief parties slept on the ground
nearby. The colonel explained that these parties arrived
after dark, worked all night, and then carefully camouflaged
all evidences of new earth and departed before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
daylight, leaving no trace of their night's work to be discovered
by prying airman. Often the work was carried
on under an intermittent shelling, but that night only
two shells had landed near them.</p>

<p>An American-manned field gun shattered the silence,
so close to us that we could feel its breath and had a
greater respect for its bite. The proximity of the gun
had not even been guessed by any of our party. A yellow
stab of flame seemed to burn the mist through which
the shell screeched on its way toward Germany.</p>

<p>Correspondent Junius Woods, who was wearing an
oversized pair of hip rubber boots, immediately strapped
the tops to his belt.</p>

<p>"I am taking no chance," he said; "I almost jumped
out of them that time. They ought to send men out with
a red flag before they pull off a blast like that."</p>

<p>The colonel then left us and with the whispering lieutenant
and runners in advance, we continued toward the
front.</p>

<p>"Walk in parties of two," was the order of the soft-toned
subaltern. "Each party keep ten yards apart.
Don't smoke. Don't talk. This road is reached by their
field pieces. They also cover it with indirect machine
gun fire. They sniped the brigade commander right
along here this morning. He had to get down into the
mud. I can afford to lose some of you, but not the entire
party. If anything comes over, you are to jump
into the communicating trenches on the right side of
the road."</p>

<p>His instructions were obeyed and it was almost with
relief that, ten minutes later, we followed him down the
slippery side of the muddy bank and landed in front of
a dugout.</p>

<p>In the long, narrow, low-ceilinged shelter which completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
tunnelled the road at a depth of twenty feet, two
twenty-year-old Americans were hugging a brazier filled
with charcoal. In this dugout was housed a group from
a machine gun battalion, some of whose members were
snoring in a double tier of bunks on the side.</p>

<p>Deep trenches at the other end of the dugout led to
the gun pits, where this new arm of the service operated
at ranges of two miles. These special squads fired over
the heads of those in front of them or over the contours
of the ground and put down a leaden barrage on the
front line of the Germans. The firing not only was indirect
but was without correction from the rectifying
observation, of which the artillery had the benefit by
watching the burst of their missiles.</p>

<p>Regaining the road, we walked on through the ruins
on the edge of the village of Seicheprey, where our way
led through a drunken colony of leaning walls and brick
piles.</p>

<p>Here was the battalion headquarters, located underneath
the old stones of a barn which was topped by the
barest skeleton of a roof. What had been the first floor
of the structure had been weighted down heavily with
railroad iron and concrete to form the roof of the commander's
dugout. The sides of the decrepit structure
bulged outward and were prevented from bursting by
timber props radiating on all sides like the legs of a centipede.
A mule team stood in front of the dugout.</p>

<p>"What's that?" the whispering lieutenant inquired in
hushed tones from a soldier in the road, as he pointed
over the mules to the battalion headquarters.</p>

<p>"What's what?" the soldier replied without respect.</p>

<p>The obscurity of night is a great reducer of ranks.
In the mist officer and man look alike.</p>

<p>"Why, that?" repeated "Whispering Willie" in lower,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
but angrier tones. "What's that there?" he reiterated,
pointing at the mules.</p>

<p>"Can't you see it's mules?" replied the man in an immoderate
tone of voice, betraying annoyance.</p>

<p>We were spared what followed. The lieutenant undoubtedly
confirmed his rank, and the man undoubtedly
proffered unto him the respect withheld by mistake. When
"Whispering Willie" joined us several minutes later in
the dugout, his helmet rode on the back of his head, but
his dignity was on straight.</p>

<p>The Battalion Commander, Major Griffith, was so glad
to see us that he sent for another bottle of the murky
grey water that came from a well on one side of a well
populated graveyard not fifty yards from his post.</p>

<p>"A good night," he said; "haven't seen it so quiet in
three years. We have inter-battalion relief on. Some
new companies are taking over the lines. Some of them
are new to the front trenches and I'm going out with
you and put them up on their toes. Wait till I report
in."</p>

<p>He rang the field telephone on the wall and waited
for an answer. An oil lamp hung from a low ceiling over
the map table. In the hot, smoky air we quietly held
our places while the connection was made.</p>

<p>"Hello," the Major said, "operator, connect me with
Milwaukee." Another wait&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hello, Milwaukee, this is Larson. I'm talking from
Hamburg. I'm leaving this post with a deck of cards
and a runner. If you want me you can get me at Coney
Island or Hinky Dink's. Wurtzburger will sit in here."</p>

<p>"Some code, Major," Lincoln Eyre, correspondent,
said. "What does a pack of cards indicate?"</p>

</div>

<p>"Why, anybody who comes out here when he doesn't
have to is a funny card," the Major replied, "and it looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
as if I have a pack of them to-night. Fritz gets quite a
few things that go over our wires and we get lots of his.
All are tapped by induction.</p>

<p>"Sometimes the stuff we get is important and sometimes
it isn't. Our wire tapping report last night carried
a passage something like this:&mdash;The German operator
at one post speaking to the operator at another said:</p>

<p>"'Hello, Herman, where did that last shell drop?'</p>

<p>"Second operator replied, 'It killed two men in a ration
party in a communicating trench and spilt all the
soup. No hot food for you to-night, Rudolph.'</p>

<p>"Herman replying: 'That's all right. We have got
some beer here.'</p>

<p>"Then there was a confusion of sounds and a German
was heard talking to some one in his dugout. He said:</p>

<p>"'Hurry, here comes the lieutenant! Hide the can!'</p>

<p>"That's the way it goes," added the Major, "but if
we heard that the society editor of the <i>Fliegende Blaetter</i>
and half a dozen pencil strafers were touring the German
front line, we'd send 'em over something that would
start 'em humming a hymn of hate. If they knew I was
joy riding a party of correspondents around the diggin's
to-night, they might give you something to write about
and cost me a platoon or two. You're not worth it.
Come on."</p>

<p>Our party now numbered nine and we pushed off,
stumbling through uneven lanes in the centre of dimly
lit ruins. According to orders, we carried gas masks in
a handy position.</p>

<p>This sector had a nasty reputation when it comes to
that sample of Teutonic culture. Fritz's poison shells
dropped almost noiselessly and, without a report, broke
open, liberating to enormous expansion the inclosed gases.
These spread in all directions, and, owing to the lowness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and dampness of the terrain, the poison clouds were imperceptible
both to sight or smell. They clung close to
the ground to claim unsuspecting victims.</p>

<p>"How are we to know if we are breathing gas or not?"
asked the Philadelphia correspondent, Mr. Henri Bazin.</p>

<p>"That's just what you <span class="smcap">don't</span> know," replied the Major.</p>

<p>"Then when will we know it is time to adjust our
masks?" Bazin persisted.</p>

<p>"When you see some one fall who has breathed it,"
the Major said.</p>

<p>"But suppose we breathe it first?"</p>

<p>"Then you won't need a mask," the Major replied,
"You see, it's quite simple."</p>

<p>"Halt!" The sharp command, coming sternly but
not too loud from somewhere in the adjacent mist,
brought the party to a standstill in the open on the edge
of the village. We remained notionless while the Major
advanced upon command from the unseen. He rejoined
us in several minutes with the remark that the challenge
had come from one of his old men, and he only hoped
the new companies taking over the line that night were
as much on their jobs.</p>

<p>"Relief night always is trying," the Major explained.
"Fritz always likes to jump the newcomers before they
get the lay of the land. He tried it on the last relief,
but we burnt him."</p>

<p>While talking the Major was leading the way through
the first trench I had ever seen above the surface of the
ground. The bottom of the trench was not only on a
level with the surrounding terrain, but in some places
it was even higher. Its walls, which rose almost to the
height of a man's head, were made of large wicker woven
cylinders filled with earth and stones.</p>

<p>Our guide informed us that the land which we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
traversing was so low that any trench dug in the ground
would simply be a ditch brimful of undrainable water,
so that, inasmuch as this position was in the first line
system, walls had been built on either side of the path to
protect passers-by from shell fragments and indirect machine
gun fire. We observed one large break where a
shell had entered during the evening.</p>

<p>Farther on, this communicating passage, which was
more corridor than trench, reached higher ground and
descended into the earth. We reeled through its zig-zag
course, staggering from one slanting corner to
another.</p>

<p>The sides were fairly well retained by French wicker
work, but every eighth or tenth duck board was missing,
making it necessary for trench travellers to step knee-deep
in cold water or to jump the gap. Correspondent Eyre,
who was wearing shoes and puttees, abhorred these
breaks.</p>

<p>We passed the Major's post of command, which he
used during intense action, and some distance on, entered
the front line. With the Major leading, we walked up to
a place where two Americans were standing on a firing
step with their rifles extended across the parapet. They
were silently peering into the grey mist over No Man's
Land. One of them looked around as we approached.
Apparently he recognised the Major's cane as a symbol
of rank. He came to attention.</p>

<p>"Well," the Major said, "is this the way you let us
walk up on you? Why don't you challenge me?"</p>

<p>"I saw you was an officer, sir," the man replied.</p>

<p>"Now, you are absolutely sure I am <span class="smcap">your</span> officer?"
the Major said slowly and coldly, with emphasis on the
word "your." "Suppose I tell you I am a German officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and these men behind me are Germans. How do you
know?"</p>

<p>With a quick movement the American brought his
rifle forward to the challenge, his right hand slapping the
wooden butt with an audible whack.</p>

<p>"Advance one, and give the countersign," he said with
a changed voice and manner and the Major, moving to
within whispering distance, breathed the word over the
man's extended bayonet. Upon hearing it, the soldier
lowered his gun and stood at attention.</p>

<p>It was difficult to figure whether his relief over the
scare was greater than his fears of the censure he knew
was coming.</p>

<p>"Next time anybody gets that close to you without
being challenged," the Major said, "don't be surprised
if it is a German. That's the way they do it. They don't
march in singing 'Deutschland Über Alles.'</p>

<p>"If you see them first, you might live through the war.
If they see you first, we will have wasted a lot of Liberty
bonds and effort trying to make a soldier out of you.
Now, remember, watch yourself."</p>

<p>We pushed on encountering longer patches of trench
where duck boards were entirely missing and where the
wading sometimes was knee-deep. In some places, either
the pounding of shells or the thawing out of the ground
had pushed in the revetments, appreciably narrowing the
way and making progress more difficult. Arriving at an
unmanned firing step large enough to accommodate the
party, we mounted and took a first look over the top.</p>

<p>Moonlight now was stronger through the mist which
hung fold over fold over the forbidden land between the
opposing battle lines. At intervals nervous machine guns
chattered their ghoulish gibberish or tut-tut-ted away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
chidingly like finicky spinsters. Their intermittent sputtering
to the right and left of us was unenlightening. We
couldn't tell whether they were speaking German or English.
Occasional bullets whining somewhere through that
wet air gave forth sounds resembling the ripping of linen
sheets.</p>

<p>Artillery fire was the exception during the entire night
but when a shell did trace its unseen arc through the mist
mantle, its echoes gave it the sound of a street car grinding
through an under-river tunnel or the tube reverberations
of a departing subway train.</p>

<p>We were two hundred yards from the German front
lines. Between their trenches and ours, at this point, was
low land, so boggy as to be almost impassable. The opposing
lines hugged the tops of two small ridges.</p>

<p>Fifty yards in front was our wire barely discernible
in the fog. The Major interrupted five wordless reveries
by expressing, with what almost seemed regretfulness,
the fact that in all his fighting experience he had never
seen it "so damn quiet." His observation passed without
a remark from us.</p>

<p>The Major appeared to be itching for action and he got
into official swing a hundred yards farther on, where a
turn in the trench revealed to us the muffled figures of
two young Americans, comfortably seated on grenade
boxes on the firing step.</p>

<p>From their easy positions they could look over the top
and watch all approaches without rising. Each one had
a blanket wrapped about his legs and feet. They looked
the picture of ease. Without moving, one, with his rifle
across his lap, challenged the Major, advanced him, and
received the countersign. We followed the Major in time
to hear his first remark:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Didn't they get the rocking chairs out here yet?" he
said with the provoked air that customarily accompanies
any condemnation of the quartermaster department.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied the seated sentry. "They didn't get
here. The men we relieved said that they never got anything
out here."</p>

<p>"Nor the footstools?" the Major continued, this time
with an unmistakable tone.</p>

<p>The man didn't answer.</p>

<p>"Do you two think you are taking moon baths on the
Riviera?" the Major asked sternly. "You are less than
two hundred yards from the Germans. You are all
wrapped up like Egyptian mummies. Somebody could
lean over the top and snake off your head with a trench
knife before you could get your feet loose. Take those
blankets off your feet and stand up."</p>

<p>The men arose with alacrity, shedding the blankets and
removing the grenade box chairs. The Major continued:</p>

<p>"You know you are not sitting in a club window in
Fifth Avenue and watching the girls go by. You're not
looking for chickens out there. There's a hawk over
there and sometimes he carries off precious little lambs.
Now, the next time anybody steps around the corner of
that trench, you be on your feet with your bayonet and
gun ready to mix things."</p>

<p>The lambs saluted as the Major moved off with a train
of followers who, by this time, were beginning to feel
that these trenches held other lambs, only they carried
notebooks instead of cartridge belts.</p>

<p>Stopping in front of a dugout, the Major gathered us
about to hear the conversation that was going on within.
Through the cracks of the door, we looked down a flight of
steep stairs, dug deep into this battlefield graveyard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
There were lights in the chamber below and the sound of
voices came up to us. One voice was singing softly.</p>

<p class='blockquot'>
"Oh, the infantry, the infantry, with the dirt behind their ears,<br />
The infantry, the infantry, they don't get any beers,<br />
The cavalry, the artillery, and the lousy engineers,<br />
They couldn't lick the infantry in a hundred million years."<br />
</p>

<p>"I got a brother in the artillery," came another voice,
"but I am ready to disown him. They talk a lot about this
counter battery work, but it's all bunk. A battery in position
has nice deep dugouts and hot chow all the time.
They gets up about 9 o'clock in the morning and shaves
up all nice for the day.</p>

<p>"'Bout 10 o'clock the captain says, 'I guess we will
drop a few shells on that German battery on the other
side of the hill.' So they pops off forty or fifty rounds
in that general direction and don't hit anything 'cause the
German battery immediately roots down into its nice, deep
dugouts. As soon as our battery lays off and gets back
into its holes, the German battery comes out and pops
back forty or fifty at 'em and, of course, don't hurt them
neither.</p>

<p>"Then it is time for lunch, and while both of these here
batteries is eating, they get so sore about not having hit
each other during the morning, that they just call off
counter battery work for the day and turn their guns
on the front lines and blow hell out of the infantry. I
haven't got any use for an artilleryman. I'm beginning
to think all of them Germans and Allies are alike and has
an agreement against the doughboys."</p>

<p>The Major interrupted by rapping sharply on the
door.</p>

<p>"Come in," was the polite and innocent invitation guilelessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
spoken from below. The Major had his helmet
on, so he couldn't tear his hair.</p>

<p>"Come up here, you idiots, every one of you."</p>

<p>The Major directed his voice down into the hole in an
unmistakable and official tone. There was a scurrying of
feet and four men emerged carrying their guns. They
were lined up against the trench wall.</p>

<p>"At midnight," the Major began, "in your dugout in
the front line forty yards from the Germans, with no
sentry at the door, you hear a knock on the door and you
shout, 'Come in.' I commend your politeness, and I
know that's what your mothers taught you to say when
visitors come, but this isn't any tea fight out here. One
German could have wiggled over the top here and stood
in this doorway and captured all four of you single-handed,
or he could have rolled a couple of bombs down
that hole and blown all of you to smithereens. What's
your aim in life&mdash;hard labour in a German prison camp
or a nice little wooden cross out here four thousand miles
from Punkinville? Why wasn't there any sentry at that
door?"</p>

<p>The question remained unanswered but the incident
had its effect on the quartet. Without orders, all four
decided to spend the remainder of the night on the firing
step with their eyes glued on the enemy's line. They
simply hadn't realised they were really in the war. The
Major knew this, but made a mental reservation of which
the commander of this special platoon got full benefit
before the night was over.</p>

<p>The front line from here onward followed a small
ridge running generally east and west, but now bearing
slightly to the northward. We were told the German line
ran in the same general direction, but at this point bore
to the southward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>The opposing lines in the direction of our course were
converging and we were approaching the place where
they were the closest in the sector. If German listening
posts heard the progress of our party through the line,
only a telephone call back to the artillery was necessary
to plant a shell among us, as every point on the system
was registered.</p>

<p>As we silently considered various eventualities immaterial
to the prosecution of the war but not without
personal concern, our progress was brought to a sudden
standstill.</p>

<p>"Huh-huh-halt!" came a drawn-out command in a
husky, throaty stammer, weaker than a whisper, from an
undersized tin-hatted youngster planted in the centre of
the trench not ten feet in front of us. His left foot was
forward and his bayoneted rifle was held ready for a
thrust.</p>

<p>"Huh-huh-huh-halt!" came the nervous, whispering
command again, although we had been motionless since
the first whisper.</p>

<p>We heard a click as the safety catch on the man's
rifle lock was thrown off and the weapon made ready to
discharge. The Major was watching the nervous hand
that rested none too steadily on the trigger stop. He
stepped to one side, but the muzzle of the gun followed
him.</p>

<p>"Huh-huh-huh-halt! I tuh-tuh-tell you."</p>

<p>This time the whisper vibrated with nervous tension
and there was no mistaking the state of mind of the
sentry.</p>

<p>"Take it easy," replied the Major with attempted
calm. "I'm waiting for you to challenge me. Don't
get excited. This is the commanding officer."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the countersign?" came from the voice in a
hard strain.</p>

<p>"Troy," the Major said, and the word seemed to bring
worlds of reassurance to the rifleman, who sighed with
relief, but forgot to move his rifle until the Major said:</p>

<p>"Will you please take that gun off me and put the
safety back in?"</p>

<p>The nervous sentry moved the gun six inches to the
right and we correspondents, standing in back of the
Major, looked into something that seemed as big as the
La Salle street tunnel. I jumped out of range behind the
Major. Eyre plunged knee-deep into water out of range,
and Woods with the rubber boots started to go over the
top.</p>

<p>The click of the replaced safety lock sounded unusually
like the snap of a trigger, but no report followed and
three hearts resumed their beating.</p>

<p>"There is no occasion to get excited," the Major said
to the young soldier in a fatherly tone. "I'm glad to
see you are wide-awake and on the job. Don't feel any
fears for your job and just remember that with that gun
and bayonet in your hands you are better than any man
who turns that trench corner or crosses out there. You've
got the advantage of him, and besides that you are a better
man than he is."</p>

<p>The sentry, now smiling, saluted the Major as the latter
conducted the party quietly around the trench corner
and into a sap leading directly out into No Man's Land.
Twice the trench passed under broad belts of barbed wire,
which we were cautioned to avoid with our helmets, because
any sound was undesirable for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>After several minutes of this cautious advance, we
reached a small listening post that marked the closest
point in the sector to the German line. Several silent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
sentries were crouching on the edge of the pit. Gunny
sacks covered the hole and screened it in front and above.
We remained silent while the Major in the lowest whisper
spoke with a corporal and learned that except for
two or three occasions, when the watchers thought they
heard sounds near our wire, the night had been calm.</p>

<p>We departed as silently as we came. The German line
from a distance of forty yards looked no different from
its appearance at a greater distance, but since it was
closer, it was carried with a constant tingle of anticipation.</p>

<p>Into another communicating trench and through better
walled fortifications of splintered forest, the Major
led us to a place where the recent shelling had changed
twenty feet of trench into a gaping gulley almost without
sides and waist-deep in water. A working detail was endeavouring
to repair the damage. In parties of two, we
left the trench and crossed an open space on the level.
The forty steps we covered across that forbidden ground
were like stolen fruit. Such rapture! Bazin, who was
seeking a title for a book, pulled "Eureka!"</p>

<p>"Over the top armed with a pencil," he said. "Not bad,
eh?"</p>

<p>Back in Seicheprey, just before the Major left us for
our long trip back to quarters, he led the way to the entrance
of a cemetery, well kept in the midst of surrounding
chaos. Graves of French dead ranged row upon row.</p>

<p>"I just wanted to show you some of the fellows that
held this line until we took it over," he said simply.
"Our own boys that we've lost since we've been here, are
buried down in the next village."</p>

<p>We silently saluted the spot as we passed it thirty
minutes later.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE NIGHT OUR GUNS CUT LOOSE</h3>


<p>As soon as our forces had made themselves at home in
the Toul sector, it was inevitable that belligerent activity
would increase and this, in spite of the issuance of strict
orders that there should be no development of the normal
daily fire. Our men could not entirely resist the temptation
to start something.</p>

<p>As was to be expected, the Germans soon began to
suspect that they were faced by different troops from the
ones who had been confronting them. The enemy set
out to verify his suspicions. He made his first raid on
the American line.</p>

<p>It was in a dense mist on the morning of January 30th
that the Germans lowered a terrific barrage on one of
our advance listening posts and then rushed the position
with a raiding party outnumbering the defendants ten
to one.</p>

<p>Two Americans held that post&mdash;five more succeeded
in making their way through the storm of falling shells
and in coming to the assistance of the first two. That
made seven Americans in the fight. When the fighting
ceased, every one of the seven had been accounted for
in the three items, dead, wounded or captured.</p>

<p>That little handful of Americans, fought, died or were
wounded in the positions which they had been ordered to
hold. Although the engagement was an extremely minor
one, it being the first of its kind on the American sector,
it was sufficient to give the enemy some idea of the determination
and fighting qualities of the individual American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
soldier. Their comrades were proud of them, and
were inclined to consider the exploit, "Alamo stuff."</p>

<p>Two of the defenders were killed, four were wounded,
and one was captured. The wounded men reported that
the captured American continued to fight even after being
severely wounded. He was the last to remain on his
feet and when a bomb blew his rifle from his hand and
injured his arm, he succumbed to superior numbers and
was carried off by his captors.</p>

<p>After the hurried sortie, the Germans beat a hasty
retreat so that the position was reoccupied immediately
by another American detail.</p>

<p>The "Alamo" seven had not been taken by surprise.
Through a downpour of rather badly placed shells, they
held their position on the firing step and worked both
their rifles and machine guns against the raiding party,
which they could not see, but knew would be advancing
behind the curtain of fire. Hundreds of empty cartridges
and a broken American bayonet constituted impartial
testimony to the fierceness of the fighting. After the
first rush, in which the defenders accounted for a number
of Germans, the fighting began at close quarters, the
enemy peppering the listening post with hand-grenades.</p>

<p>In the meantime the German barrage had been lifted
and lengthened until it was lowered again between the
"Alamo" seven and their comrades in the rear.</p>

<p>There were calls to surrender, but no acceptances. The
fighting became hand-to-hand with bayonet and gun butt.
The defenders fought on in the hope that assistance soon
would arrive from the American artillery.</p>

<p>But the Germans had planned the raid well. Their first
barrage cut all telephone wires leading back from our
front lines and the signal rocket which one of the men in
the listening post had fired into the air, had been smothered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
in the dense mist. That rocket had called for a
defensive barrage from American artillery and when
no answer came to it, a second one was fired, but that
also was snuffed out by the fog.</p>

<p>The net result of the raid was that the Germans had
captured one of our wounded men and had thereby identified
the organisation opposing them as the First Regular
Division of the United States Army, composed of
the 16th, 18th, 26th, and 28th Regular U. S. Infantry
Regiments and the 5th, 6th and 7th Regular U. S. Army
Field Artillery. The division was under the command
of Major General Robert Lee Bullard.</p>

<p>In the days and weeks that followed, the daily exchange
of shells on the sector increased to two and three times
the number it had been before our men arrived there.
There were nightly patrols in No Man's Land and
several instances where these patrols met in the dark and
engaged one another with casualties on both sides.</p>

<p>One night a little over a month later&mdash;the early morning
of March 4th, to be exact&mdash;it was my privilege to
witness from an exceptional vantage point, the first
planned and concentrated American artillery action
against the enemy. The German lines selected for this
sudden downpour of shell, comprised two small salients
jutting out from the enemy's positions in the vicinity of
the ruined village of Lahayville, in the same sector.</p>

<p>In company with an orderly who had been despatched
as my guide, I started from an artillery battalion headquarters
shortly before midnight, and together we made
our way up the dark muddy road that led through the
dense Bois de la Reine to the battery positions. Half an
hour's walk and O'Neil, the guide, led me off the road
into a darker tunnel of overlaced boughs where we
stumbled along on the ties of a narrow gauge railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
that conveyed heavy shells from the road to the guns.
We passed through several gun pits and stopped in front
of a huge <i>abri</i> built entirely above ground.</p>

<p>Its walls and roof must have been between five and
seven feet thick and were made from layers of logs,
sandbags, railroad iron and slabs of concrete reinforced
with steel. It looked impenetrable.</p>

<p>"Battery commander's headquarters," O'Neil said to
me as we entered a small hot room lighted by two oil
lamps and a candle. Three officers, at two large map
tables, were working on sheets of figures. Two wooden
bunks, one above the other, and two posts supporting the
low ceiling completed the meagre furnishings of the
room. A young officer looked up from his work, O'Neil
saluted, and addressed him.</p>

<p>"The Major sent me up with this correspondent. He
said you could let him go wherever he could see the fun
and that you are not responsible for his safety." O'Neil
caught the captain's smile at the closing remark and
withdrew. The captain showed me the map.</p>

<p>"Here we are," he said, indicating a spot with his
finger, "and here's what we are aiming at to-night. There
are two places you can stay to see the fun. You can stay
in this shelter and hear the sound of it, or you can go up
a little further front to this point, and mount the platform
in our observation tree. In this <i>abri</i> you are safe
from splinters and shrapnel but a direct hit would wipe
us out. In the tree you are exposed to direct hits and
splinters from nearby bursts but at least you can see
the whole show. It's the highest point around here and
overlooks the whole sector."</p>

<p>I sensed that the captain expected a busy evening and
looked forward with no joy to possible interference from
a questioning visitor, so I chose the tree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right," he said, "you've got helmet and gas masks,
I see. Now how's your watch? Take the right time off
mine. We have just synchronised ours with headquarters.
Zero is one o'clock. You had better start now."</p>

<p>He called for an orderly with a German name, and the
two of us left. Before I was out of the room, the captain
had returned to his mathematics and was figuring
out the latest range variations and making allowances
for latest developments in wind, temperature and barometer.
The orderly with the German name and I plunged
again into the trees and brought up shortly on the edge
of a group of men who were standing in the dark near
a large tree trunk. I could hear several other men and
some stamping horses off to one side.</p>

<p>The party at the foot of the tree was composed of observers,
signal linemen and runners. All of them were
enlisted men. I inquired who were to be my comrades in
the tree top and three presented themselves. One said
his name was Pat Guahn, the second gave his as Peter
Griffin and the third acknowledged Mike Stanton. I
introduced myself and Griffin said, "I see we are all
from the same part of Italy."</p>

<p>At twenty minutes to one, we started up the tree,
mounting by rudely constructed ladders that led from
one to the other of the four crudely fashioned platforms.
We reached the top breathless and with no false impressions
about the stability of our swaying perch. The tree
seemed to be the tallest in the forest and nothing interfered
with our forward view. The platform was a bit
shaky and Guahn put my thoughts to words and music by
softly singing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Rock-a-bye baby, in the tree top,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the shell comes the runners all flop,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
<span class="i0">When the shell busts, good-bye to our station,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We're up in a tree, bound for damnation."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The compass gives us north and we locate in the forward
darkness an approximate sweep of the front lines.
Guahn is looking for the flash of a certain German gun
and it will be his duty to keep his eyes trained through
the fork of a certain marked twig within arm's reach.</p>

<p>"If she speaks, we want to know it," Guahn says; "I
can see her from here when she flashes and there's another
man who can see her from another place. You see
we get an intersection of angles on her and then we know
where she is just as though she had sent her address.
Two minutes later we drop a card on her and keep her
warm."</p>

<p>"Is that that gun from Russia we heard about?" Griffin
asks.</p>

<p>"No," answers Guahn, "we are not looking for her
from that station. Besides, she isn't Russian. She was
made by the British, used by the Russians, captured by
the Germans and in turn is used by them against Americans.
We have found pieces of her shell and they all
have an English trade mark on them. She fires big
eight inch stuff."</p>

<p>Griffin is watching in another direction for another
flash and Stanton is on the lookout for signal flares and
the flash of a signal light projector which might be used
in case the telephone communication is disturbed by
enemy fire. It is then that the runners at the base of
the tree must carry the message back by horse.</p>

<p>Only an occasional thump is heard forward in the
darkness. Now and then machine guns chatter insanely
as they tuck a seam in the night. At infrequent intervals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
a star shell curves upward, bursts, suspends its
silent whiteness in mid-air, and dies.</p>

<p>In our tree top all seems quiet and so is the night.
There is no moon and only a few stars are out. A penetrating
dampness takes the place of cold and there is that
in the air that threatens a change of weather.</p>

<p>The illuminated dial of my watch tells me that it is
three minutes of one and I communicate the information
to the rest of the Irish quartet. In three minutes, the
little world that we look upon from our tree top is due
to change with terrific suddenness and untold possibilities.</p>

<p>Somewhere below in the darkness and to one side, I
hear the clank of a ponderous breech lock as the mechanism
is closed on a shell in one of the heavy guns.
Otherwise all remains silent.</p>

<p>Two minutes of one. Each minute seems to drag like
an hour. It is impossible to keep one's mind off that
unsuspecting group of humans out there in that little
section of German trench upon which the heavens are
about to fall. Griffin leans over the railing and calls to
the runners to stand by the horses' heads until they become
accustomed to the coming roar.</p>

<p>One minute of one. We grip the railing and wait.</p>

<p>Two flashes and two reports, the barest distinguishable
interval, and the black horizon belches red. From extreme
left to extreme right the flattened proscenium in
front of us glows with the ghastliness of the Broockon.</p>

<p>Waves of light flush the dark vault above like the night
sky over South Chicago's blast furnaces. The heavens
reflect the glare. The flashes range in colour from blinding
yellow to the softest tints of pink. They seem to
form themselves from strange combinations of greens
and mauves and lavenders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>The sharp shattering crash of the guns reaches our
ears almost on the instant. The forest shakes and our
tree top sways with the slam of the heavies close by. The
riven air whimpers with the husky whispering of the
rushing load of metal bolts passing above us.</p>

<p>Looking up into that void, we deny the uselessness of
the act and seek in vain to follow the trains of those unseen
things that make the air electric with their presence.
We hear them coming, passing, going, but see not one
of them.</p>

<p>"There's whole blacksmith's shops sailing over our
heads on the way to Germany," Pat Guahn shouts in my
ear. "I guess the Dutchman sure knows how to call for
help. He doesn't care for that first wallop, and he
thinks he would like about a half million reserves from
the Russian front."</p>

<p>"That darkness out in No Man's Land don't make any
hit with him either," Stanton contributes. "He's got it
lit up so bright I'm homesick for Broadway."</p>

<p>Now comes the thunder of the shell arrivals. You
know the old covered wooden bridges that are still to
be found in the country. Have you ever heard a team
of horses and a farm wagon thumping and rumbling over
such a bridge on the trot?</p>

<p>Multiply the horse team a thousand times. Lash the
animals from the trot to the wild gallop. Imagine the
sound of their stampede through the echoing wooden
structure and you approach in volume and effect the
rumble and roar of the steel as it rained down on that
little German salient that night.</p>

<p>"Listen to them babies bustin'," says Griffin. "I'm
betting them groundhogs is sure huntin' their holes right
now and trying to dig clear through to China."</p>

<p>That was the sound and sight of that opening salvo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
from all guns, from the small trench mortars in the line,
the lightest field pieces behind them, the heavy field pieces
about us and the ponderous railroad artillery located
behind us.</p>

<p>Its crash has slashed the inkiness in front of us with
a lurid red meridian. I don't know how many hands had
pulled lanyards on exactly the same instant but the consequent
spread of fire looked like one continuous flame.</p>

<p>Now the "seventy-fives" are speaking, not in unison,
but at various speeds, limited only by the utmost celerity
of the sweating gun crews.</p>

<p>But the German front line is not the only locality receiving
unsolicited attention. Enemy gun positions far
behind the lines are being plastered with high explosives
and anesthetised with gas shells.</p>

<p>So effective is the American artillery neutralisation of
the German batteries, that it is between fifteen and twenty
minutes before the first enemy gun replies to the terrific
barrage. And though expected momentarily, a German
counter barrage fails to materialise.</p>

<p>In our tree top we wait for the enemy's counter shelling
but the retaliation does not develop. When occupying
an exposed position, the suspense of waiting for an
impending blow increases in tenseness as the delay continues
and the expectations remain unrealised. With no
inclination to be unreasonable, one even prays for the
speedy delivery of the blow in the same way that the
man with the aching tooth urges the dentist to speed up
and have it over with.</p>

<p>"Why in hell don't they come back at us?" Griffin
asks. "I've had myself all tuned up for the last twenty
minutes to have a leg blown off and be thankful. I hate
this waiting stuff."</p>

<p>"Keep your shirt on, Pete," Stanton remarks. "Give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
'em a chance to get their breath and come out of their
holes. That barrage drove 'em down a couple hundred
feet into the ground and they haven't any elevators to
come up on. We'll hear from 'em soon enough."</p>

<p>We did, but it was not more than a whisper as compared
with what they were receiving from our side of the
line. The German artillery came into lethargic action
after the American barrage had been in constant operation
for thirty minutes and then the enemy's fire was only
desultory. Only an occasional shell from Kulturland
came our way, and even they carried a rather tired, listless
buzz, as though they didn't know exactly where they
were going and didn't care.</p>

<p>Six or eight of them hummed along a harmless orbit
not far above our tree top and fell in the forest. It certainly
looked as though we were shooting all the hard-stuff
and the German end of the fireworks party was all
coloured lights and Roman candles. Of the six shells
that passed us, three failed to explode upon landing.</p>

<p>"That makes three dubs," said Guahn.</p>

<p>"You don't mean dubs," Stanton corrected him, "you
mean duds and even then you are wrong. Those were
gas pills. They just crack open quietly so you don't know
it until you've sniffed yourself dead. Listen, you'll hear
the gas alert soon."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, we heard through the firing the
throaty gurgling of the sirens. The alarm started on
our right and spread from station to station through the
woods. We adjusted the respirators and turned our
muffled faces toward the firing line. Through the moisture
fogged glasses of my mask, I looked first upon my
companions on this rustic scaffold above the forest.</p>

<p>War's demands had removed our appearances far from
the human. Our heads were topped with uncomfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
steel casques, harder than the backs of turtles. Our eyes
were large, flat, round glazed surfaces unblinking and
owl-like. Our faces were shapeless folds of black rubber
cloth. Our lungs sucked air through tubes from a
canvass bag under our chins and we were inhabiting a
tree top like a family of apes. It really required imagination
to make it seem real.</p>

<p>"Looks like the party is over," came the muffled remark
from the masked figure beside me. The cannonading
was dying down appreciably. The blinking line of
lights in front of us grew less.</p>

<p>A terrific upward blast of red and green flame from
the ground close to our tree, reminded us that one heavy
still remained under firing orders. The flash seen through
the forest revealed in intricate tracings the intertwining
limbs and branches of the trees. It presented the appearance
of a piece of strong black lace spread out and held
at arm's length in front of a glowing grate.</p>

<p>From the German lines an increased number of flares
shot skyward and as the cannon cracks ceased, save for
isolated booms, the enemy machine guns could be heard
at work, riveting the night with sprays of lead and sounding
for all the world like a scourge of hungry woodpeckers.</p>

<p>"God help any of the doughboys that are going up
against any of that stuff," Griffin observed through his
mask.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about our doughboys," replied Stanton;
"they are all safe in their trenches now. That's
most likely the reason why our guns were ordered to lay
off. I guess Fritzie got busy with his typewriters too
late."</p>

<p>I descended the tree, leaving my companions to wait
for the orders necessary for their departure. Unfamiliar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
with the unmarked paths of the forest and guided only
as to general directions, I made my way through the
trees some distance in search of the road back from the
front.</p>

<p>A number of mud and water-filled shell holes intervened
to make the exertion greater and consequently the
demand upon lungs for air greater. After floundering
several kilometres through a strange forest with a gas
mask on, one begins to appreciate the temptation that
comes to tear off the stifling nose bag and risk asphyxiation
for just one breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>A babel of voices in the darkness to one side guided
me to a log cabin where I learned from a sentry that
the gas scare had just been called off. Continuing on
the road, I collided head on in the darkness with a walking
horse. Its rider swore and so did I, with slightly
the advantage over him as his head was still encased. I
told him the gas alarm was off and he tore away the
mask with a sigh of relief. I left him while he was removing
the horse's gas mask.</p>

<p>A light snow was beginning to fall as I said good-night
to the battalion commander in front of his roadside
shack. A party of mounted runners was passing on the
way to their quarters. With an admirable lack of dignity
quite becoming a national guard cavalry major in command
of regular army artillery, he said:</p>

<p>"Good-night, men, we licked hell out of them."</p>

<p>The Toul sector, during its occupation by Americans,
always maintained a high daily rating of artillery activity.
The opposing forces were continually planning surprises
on one another. At any minute of the night or
day a terrific bombardment of high explosive or gas
might break out on either side. Both sides operated their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
sound ranging apparatus to a rather high degree of
efficiency.</p>

<p>By these delicate instruments we could locate the exact
position of an unseen enemy battery. Following that
location, the battery would immediately be visited with
a concentrated downpour of hot steel intended to wipe it
out of existence. The enemy did as much for us, so
that in the artillery, when the men were not actually
manning the guns in action, they were digging gun pits
for reserve positions which they could occupy if the
enemy happened to get the proper range of the old
positions. In this casual counter battery work our artillery
adopted a system by which many lives were saved.</p>

<p>If a German battery began shelling one of our battery
positions, the artillerymen in that position were not called
upon to stand by their guns and return the fire. The
order would be given to temporarily abandon the position
and the men would be withdrawn a safe distance. The
German battery that was firing would be responded to,
two to one, by other American batteries located nearby
and which did not happen to be under fire at the time.
By this system we conserved our strength.</p>

<p>Our infantry was strong in their praise of the artillery.
I observed this particularly one day on the Toul
front when General Pershing dropped in unexpectedly
at the division headquarters, then located in the hillside
village of Bourcq. While the commander and his party
were awaiting a meal which was being prepared, four
muddy figures tramped down the hallway of the Château.
Through the doorway the general observed their entrance.</p>

<p>The two leading figures were stolid German soldiers,
prisoners of war, and behind them marched their captors,
two excusably proud young Americans. One of them
carried his bayoneted rifle at the ready, while the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
carried the equipment which had been taken from the
prisoners. The American commander ordered the group
brought before him and asked one of the Americans to
relate the story of the capture.</p>

<p>"We in the infantry got 'em, sir," replied one, "but
the artillery deserved most of the credit. It happened
just at dawn this morning. Jim here, and myself, were
holding down an advance machine gun post when the
Germans laid down a flock of shells on our first line
trench. We just kept at the gun ready to let them have
it if they started to come over.</p>

<p>"Pretty soon we saw them coming through the mist and
we began to put it to 'em. I think we got a bunch of
them but they kept on coming.</p>

<p>"Then somebody back in our first line shot up the
signal for a barrage in our sector. It couldn't have been
a minute before our cannon cut loose and the shells began
to drop right down in the middle of the raiding party.</p>

<p>"It was a good heavy barrage, sir, and it cut clean
through the centre of the raiders. Two Germans were
ahead of the rest and the barrage landed right in back of
them. The rest started running back toward their lines,
but the first pair could not go back because they would
have had to pass through the barrage. I kept the machine
gun going all the time and Jim showed himself above the
trench and pointed his rifle at the cut-off pair.</p>

<p>"They put up their hands right quick and we waved to
'em to come in. They took it on the jump and landed
in our trench as fast as they could. We took their equipment
off them and we were ordered to march them back
here to headquarters. That's all there was to it, sir."</p>

<p>The enemy in front of Toul manifested an inordinate
anxiety to know more about the strength of our forces
and the character of the positions we occupied. A captured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
German document issued to the Fifth Bavarian
Landwehr infantry brigade instructed every observer and
patrol to do his or its best "to bring information about
the new enemy."</p>

<p>"Nothing is known as yet about the methods of fighting
or leadership," the document set forth, "and all information
possible must be gathered as to particular features
of American fighting and outpost tactics. This
will then be used for extending the information bulletin.
Any observation or identification, however insignificant,
may be of the greatest value."</p>

<p>The document directed that data on the following questions
be obtained:</p>

<p>"Are sentry posts sentry posts or stronger posts?
Further advanced reconnoitring patrols? Manner of
challenging? Behaviour on post during day and night?
Vigilance? Ambush tactics and cunning?</p>

<p>"Do they shoot and signal on every occasion? Do
the posts hold their ground on the approach of a patrol,
or do they fall back?</p>

<p>"Are the Americans careful and cautious? Are they
noisy? What is their behaviour during smoke screens?"</p>

<p>The enemy's keen desire to acquire this information
was displayed in the desperate efforts it made. One day
the French troops occupying the trenches on the right
flank of the American sector, encountered a soldier in
an American uniform walking through their positions.</p>

<p>He was stopped and questioned. He said he had been
one of an American patrol that had gone out the night
before, that he had lost his way in No Man's Land
and that he thought he was returning to his own trenches,
when he dropped into those held by the French.</p>

<p>Although the man wore our uniform and spoke excellent
English and seemed straightforward in his replies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
as to his name and rank and organisation, the French
officer before whom he was brought was not completely
satisfied. To overcome this hesitancy, the suspected
man opened his shirt and produced an American identification
tag verifying his answers.</p>

<p>The French officer, still suspicious, ordered the man
held while he telephoned to the American organisation
mentioned to ascertain whether any man of the name
given was missing from that unit.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the American captain. "We lost him
last October, when we were in the front line down in the
Luneville sector. He was captured with eight others
by the Germans."</p>

<p>"Well, we've got him over here on your right flank.
He came into our lines this morning&mdash;" the French officer
started to say.</p>

<p>"Bully," came the American interruption over the
wire. "He's escaped from the Germans and has come
clear through their lines to get back to his company. He'll
get a D. S. C. for that. We'll send right over for him."</p>

<p>"But when we questioned him," replied the Frenchman,
"he said he left your lines only last night on patrol
and got lost in No Man's Land."</p>

<p>"I'll come right over and look at that party, myself,"
the American captain hastily replied.</p>

<p>He reached the French officer's dugout several hours
later and the suspect was ordered brought in.</p>

<p>"He must be crazy, sir," the French orderly said.
"He tried to kill himself a few minutes ago and we have
had to hold him."</p>

<p>The man was brought into the dugout between two
poilus who held his arms. The American captain took
a careful look and said:</p>

<p>"That's not our man. He wears our uniform correctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and that's our regulation identification tag. Both of
them must have been taken away from our man when
he was captured. This man is an impostor."</p>

<p>"He's more than that," replied the Frenchman with a
smile. "He's a German spy."</p>

<p>The prisoner made no reply, but later made a full
confession of his act, and also gave to his interrogators
much valuable information, which, however, did not
save him from paying the penalty in front of a firing
squad. When he faced the rifles, he was not wearing
the stolen uniform.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>INTO PICARDY TO MEET THE GERMAN PUSH</h3>


<p>Toward the end of March, 1918, just at the time when
the American Expeditionary Forces were approaching the
desired degree of military effectiveness, the fate of civilisation
was suddenly imperilled by the materialisation
of the long expected German offensive.</p>

<p>This push, the greatest the enemy had ever attempted,
began on March 21st, and the place that Hindenburg
selected for the drive was Picardy, the valley of the
Somme, the ancient cockpit of Europe. On that day the
German hordes, scores upon scores of divisions, hurled
themselves against the British line between Arras and
Noyon.</p>

<p>Before that tremendous weight of manpower, the
Allied line was forced to give and one of the holding
British armies, the Fifth, gave ground on the right flank,
and with its left as a hinge, swung back like a gate, opening
the way for the Germans toward Paris.</p>

<p>There have been many descriptions of the fierce fighting
put up by the French and British to stem the German
advance, but the most interesting one that ever came to
my notice, came from one of the few American soldiers
that participated in the defence. Two weeks after the
opening of the battle and at a time when the German advance
had been stopped, I came upon this American in
a United States Military Hospital at Dijon.</p>

<p>An interne led me to the bedside of Jimmy Brady, a
former jockey from the Pimlico turf in Baltimore, and
now a proud wearer of Uncle Sam's khaki. In his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
quaint way, Jimmy told me the story of what a little
handful of Americans did in the great battle in Picardy.
Jimmy knew. Jimmy had been there.</p>

<p>"Lad," he said, "I'm telling you it was a real jam.
I learned one hell of a headful in the last ten days that
I'll not be forgetting in the next ten years. I've got
new ideas about how long this war is goin' to last. Of
course, we're going to lick the Boches before it ends,
but I've sorter given up the picture I had of myself marching
up Fifth Avenue in a victory parade on this coming
Fourth of July. I'll say it can't be done in that time.</p>

<p>"Our outfit from old &mdash;&mdash; engineers, and believe me
there's none better, have been working up in the Somme
country for the last two months. We were billeted at
Brie and most of our work had been throwing bridges
across the Canal du Nord about three miles south of
Peronne. I'm telling you the Somme ain't a river. It's
a swamp, and they just hardly squeeze enough water
outer it to make a canal which takes the place of a river.</p>

<p>"We was working under the British. Their old bridges
over the canal were wooden affairs and most of them
had signs on them reading, 'This bridge won't hold a
tank,' and that bridge wouldn't bear trotting horses, and
so on. Some of 'em we tore down must have been put
in for scenery purposes only. We were slamming up
some husky looking steel structures like you see in the
States, and believe me it makes me sick to think that we
had to blow 'em all up again before the Boches got to 'em.</p>

<p>"I see by the papers that the battle began on the 21st,
but I've got no more idea about the date of it than the
King of Honolulu. They say it's been on only about ten
days, but I couldn't swear it hadn't been on since New
Year's Eve. It sure seemed a long time. As I told you,
we were working just south of Peronne on the main road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
between St. Quentin and Amiens. She started on a foggy
morning and for two days the music kept getting closer.
On the first day, all traffic was frontward, men, guns, and
camions going up towards the lines, and then the tide
began to flow back.</p>

<p>"Ambulances and camions, full of poor wounded devils,
filled the road, and then came labour battalions of
chattering Chinks, Egyptians, and Fiji Islanders and
God knows what. None of these birds were lingering,
because the enemy was sprinkling the roads with shells
and sorter keeping their marching spirits up. Orders
came for us to ditch our packs and equipment all except
spades, rifles, belts and canteens, and we set off toward
the rear.</p>

<p>"Do you mind your map of the Somme? Well, we
pulls up at Chaulnes for a breath. It was a big depot
and dump town&mdash;aeroplanes and everything piled up in
it. We were ordered onto demolition work, being as we
was still classed as non-combatants. I don't know how
many billions of dollars' worth of stuff we blew up and
destroyed, but it seemed to me there was no end of it.
Fritz kept coming all the time and they hiked us on to
Aubercourt and then to Dormant, and each place we
stopped and dug trenches, and then they shoots us into
camions and rushes us north to a town not far out of
Amiens.</p>

<p>"With about forty men, we marched down the road,
this time as non-combatants no longer. We stopped just
east of the village of Marcelcave and dug a line of
trenches across the road. We had twenty machine guns
and almost as many different kinds of ammunition as
there was different nationalities in our trench. Our position
was the fifth line of defence, we was told, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
guns kept getting closer and a lot of that long range stuff
was giving us hell. Near me there was a squad of my men,
one Chink, three Canadians, and we two Dublin fusileers.</p>

<p>"Then we begin to see our own guns, that is, British
guns, beginning to blow hell out of this here village of
Marcelcave right in front of us. It made me wild to see
the artillery making a mistake like that, so I says to one of
these here Dublin fusileers:</p>

<p>"'Whatinell's 'matter wid dose guns firing on our own
men up there in the village? If this is the fifth line, then
that must be our fourth line in the village?'</p>

<p>"'Lad,' says the Dublin fusileer to me, 'I don't want
to discourage you for the life of me, but this only used
to be the fifth line. We are in the first line now and it's up
to you and me and the Chink and the rest of us to keep the
Fritzes out of Amiens. At this moment we are all that's
between.'</p>

<p>"We started to the machine guns and began pouring
it in on 'em. The minute some of 'em would start out of
the town we would wither them. Holy mother, but what
a beautiful murder it was!</p>

<p>"I didn't know then, and don't know yet, what has
become of all the rest of our officers and men, but I sorter
felt like every shot I sent over was paying 'em back
for some of their dirty work. We kept handing it to
'em hot. You oughter seen that Chink talking Mongolian
to a machine gun, and, believe me, he sure made
it understand him. I'm here to say that when a Chink
fights, he's a fighting son-of-a-gun and don't let anybody
kid you different.</p>

<p>"Well, our little mob held 'em off till dark and then
British Tommies piled in and relieved us. We needed
it because we hadn't had a bite in seventy hours and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
had been lying in the mud and water for twice that time.
Just before relief comes on, two skulking figures comes
over the top. I was thinking that maybe these was
Hindus or Eskimos coming to join our little international
party and we shouts out to 'em and asks 'em where
they hails from. Both of 'em yelled back, 'Kamerad,'
and then I knew that we'd not only held the fort, but
had captured two prisoners even if they was deserters.</p>

<p>"I marched 'em back that night to the next town and
took 'em into a grocery store, where there was a lot of
Tommies helping themselves to the first meal in days.
While we were eating bread and cheese and sardines
and also feeding me two prisoners, we talks to them
and finds out that, as far as they are concerned, the
Kaiser will never get their vote again.</p>

<p>"One Tommy says to one of my prisoners: 'Kaiser no
good&mdash;pas bon, ain't it?' and the prisoner said, 'Yah,'
and I shoved my elbow into his ribs and right quick he
said, 'Nein.' Then the Tommy said: 'Hindenburg
dirty rotter, nacy pa?' and the Fritz said, 'Yah. Nein,'
and then looked at me and said 'Yah' again. They was
not bad prisoners and I marched 'em twenty miles that
night, just the three of us&mdash;two of them in front and
me in back with the rifle over me arm.</p>

<p>"And the joke of it was that both of them could
have taken the gun and killed me any minute for all I
could have done."</p>

<p>"How do you figure that, Corporal?" I asked.</p>

<p>For reply, Jimmy Brady drew from beneath the
blankets a pair of knotted hands with fingers and thumbs
stiffened and bent in and obviously impossible to use on
a trigger. Brady is not in the hospital for wounds.
Four days and nights in water and mud in the battle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
battles had twisted and shrunken him with rheumatism.
But he is one rheumatic who helped to save Amiens.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Upon the heels of the German successes in Picardy,
developments followed fast. Principal among these,
was the materialisation of a unified command of all
the armies of the Allies. General Ferdinand Foch
was selected and placed in supreme command of every
fighting man under the Allied flags.</p>

<p>One of the events that led up to this long delayed
action, was the unprecedented action of General Pershing,
when he turned over the command of all the American
forces in France to General Foch. He did this with
the words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I come to say to you that the American people would
hold it a great honour for our troops were they engaged
in the present battle. I ask it of you in my name and
in that of the American people.</p>

<p>"There is at this moment no other question than that
of fighting. Infantry, artillery, aviation&mdash;all that we
have are yours to dispose of as you will. Others are
coming which are as numerous as will be necessary.
I have come to say to you that the American people
would be proud to be engaged in the greatest battle in
history."</p></div>

<p>The action met with the unqualified endorsement of
every officer and man in the American forces. From
that minute on, the American slogan in France was
"Let's go," and every regiment began to hope that it
would be among the American organisations selected
to do battle with the German in Picardy. Secretary of
War Baker, then in France, expressed his pleasure over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
General Pershing's unselfish offer with the following
public statement on Mar. 30th:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I am delighted with the prompt and effective action
of General Pershing in placing all American troops at
the disposal of the Allies in the present situation. His
action will meet with hearty approval in the United
States, where the people desire their Expeditionary
Force to be of the utmost service to the common cause.</p>

<p>"I have visited practically all the American troops in
France, some of them quite recently, and had an opportunity
to observe the enthusiasm with which the officers
and men receive the announcement that they may be
used in the present conflict. Regiments to which the
announcement was made, broke spontaneously into
cheers."</p></div>

<p>Particularly were there cheers when the news spread
through the ranks of the First United States division,
then on duty on the line in front of Toul, that it had
been the first American division chosen to go into
Picardy. I was fortunate enough to make arrangements
to go with them.</p>

<p>I rode out from old positions with the guns and
boarded the troop train which took our battery by devious
routes to changes of scenery, gratifying both to
vision and spirit. We lived in our cars on tinned meat
and hard bread, washed down with swallows of <i>vin
ordinaire</i>, hurriedly purchased at station <i>buvettes</i>. The
horses rode well.</p>

<p>Officers and men, none of us cared for train schedule
simply because none of us knew where we were going,
and little time was wasted in conjecture. Soldierly
curiosity was satisfied with the knowledge that we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
on our way, and with this satisfaction, the hours passed
easily. In fact, the blackjack game in the officers' compartment
had reached the point where the battery commander
had garnered almost all of the French paper
money in sight, when our train passed slowly through
the environs of Paris.</p>

<p>Other American troop trains had preceded us, because
where the railroad embankment ran close and parallel
to the street of some nameless Faubourg, our appearance
was met with cheers and cries from a welcoming regiment
of Paris street gamins, who trotted in the street
beside the slow moving troop train and shouted and
threw their hats and wooden shoes in the air. Sous
and fifty centime pieces and franc pieces showered from
the side doors of the horses' cars as American soldiers,
with typical disregard for the value of money, pitched
coin after coin to the scrambling mob of children. At
least a hundred francs must have been cast out upon
those happy, romping waves of childish faces and up-stretched
dirty hands.</p>

<p>"A soldier would give his shirt away," said a platoon
commander, leaning out of the window and watching the
spectacle, and surreptitiously pitching a few coins himself.
"Hope we get out of this place before the men
pitch out a gun or a horse to that bunch. Happy little
devils, aren't they? It's great to think we are on our
way up to meet their daddies."</p>

<p>Unnumbered hours more passed merrily in the troop
train before we were shunted into the siding of a
little town. Work of unloading was started and completed
within an hour. Guns and wagons were unloaded
on the quay, while the animals were removed from the
cars on movable runways or ramps. As each gun or
wagon reached the ground, its drivers hitched in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
horses and moved it away. Five minutes later we rode
out of the yards and down the main street of the town.</p>

<p>Broad steel tires on the carriages of the heavies
bumped and rumbled over the clean cobbles and the
horses pranced spryly to get the kinks out of their legs,
long fatigued from vibrations of the train. Women, old
and young, lined the curbs, smiling and throwing kisses,
waving handkerchiefs and aprons and begging for souvenirs.
If every request for a button had been complied
with, our battery would have reached the front
with a shocking shortage of safety pins.</p>

<p>Darkness came on and with it a fine rain, as we cleared
the town and halted on a level plain between soft fields
of tender new wheat, which the horses sensed and snorted
to get at. In twenty minutes, Mess Sergeant Kelly,
from his high altar on the rolling kitchen, announced
that the last of hot coffee had been dispensed. Somewhere
up ahead in the darkness, battery bugle notes conveyed
orders to prepare to mount. With the rattle of
equipment and the application of endearing epithets,
which horses unfortunately don't understand, we moved
off at the sound of "forward."</p>

<p>Off on our left, a noiseless passenger train slid silently
across the rim of the valley, blue dimmed lights in its
coach windows glowing like a row of wet sulphur
matches. Far off in the north, flutters of white light
flushed the night sky and an occasional grumbling of
the distant guns gave us our first impression of the
battle of battles. Every man in our battery tingled with
the thrill. This was riding frontward with the guns&mdash;this
was rolling and rumbling on through the night up
toward the glare and glamour of war. I was riding
beside the captain at the head of the column. He broke
silence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>"It seems like a far cry from Honolulu with the
moon playing through the palm trees on the beach," he
said quizzically, "to this place and these scenes and
events to-night, but a little thing like a flip of coin decided
it for me, and I'm blessing that coin to-night.</p>

<p>"A year ago January, before we came into the war,
I was stationed at San Antonio. Another officer friend
of mine was stationed there and one day he received
orders to report for duty at Honolulu. He had a girl
in San Antonio and didn't want to leave her and he
knew I didn't have a girl and didn't give a damn where
I went, or was sent, so long as it was with the army.
He put up the proposition of mutual exchange being
permitted under regulations.</p>

<p>"He wanted to take my place in San Antonio and
give me his assignment in Honolulu, which I must say
looked mighty good in those days to anybody who was
tired of Texas. I didn't think then we'd ever come to
war and besides it didn't make much difference to me
one way or the other where I went. But instead of accepting
the proposition right off the reel, I told Jim
we'd flip a coin to decide.</p>

<p>"If it came tails, he would go to Honolulu. If it
came heads, I would go to Honolulu. He flipped. Tails
won. I'm in France and poor Jim is out there in
Honolulu tending the Ukulele crop with prospects of
having to stay there for some time. Poor devil, I got
a letter from him last week.</p>

<p>"Do you know, man knows no keener joy in the world
than that which I have to-night. Here I am in France
at the head of two hundred and fifty men and horses
and the guns and we're rolling up front to kick a dent in
history. The poor unfortunate that ain't in this fight has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
almost got license to shoot himself. Life knows no
keener joy than this."</p>

<p>It was a long speech for our captain, but his words
expressed not only the feeling of our battery, but our
whole regiment, from the humblest wagon driver up to
the colonel who, by the way, has just made himself most
unpopular with the regiment by being promoted to a
Brigadier Generalship. The colonel is passing upward
to a higher command and the regiment is sore on losing
him. One of his humblest critics has characterised the
event as the "first rough trick the old man ever pulled."</p>

<p>Midnight passed and we were still wheeling our way
through sleeping villages, consulting maps under rays of
flashlights, gathering directions some of the time from
mile posts and wall signs, and at other times gaining
knowledge of roads and turns and hills from sleepy
heads in curl wrappers that protruded from bedroom
chambers and were over-generous in advice.</p>

<p>The animals were tired. Rain soaked the cigarettes
and made them draw badly. Above was drizzle and
below was mud. There were a few grumbles, but no
man in our column would have traded places with a
brother back home even if offered a farm to boot.</p>

<p>It was after three in the morning when we parked
the guns in front of a château, brought forward some
lagging combat wagons and discovered the rolling
kitchen had gone astray. In another hour the animals
had been unhitched but not unharnessed, fed and
watered in darkness and the men, in utter weariness,
prepared to lie down and sleep anywhere. At this juncture,
word was passed through the sections that the
battery would get ready to move immediately. Orders
were to clear the village by six o'clock. Neither men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
nor horses were rested, but we moved out on time and
breakfasted on the road.</p>

<p>The way seemed long, the roads bad and the guns
heavy. But we were passing through an Eden of beauty&mdash;green
fields and rolling hills crested by ancient
châteaux. At times, the road wound down through
hillside orchards, white and pink with apple blooms.
Fatigue was heavy on man and beast, but I heard one
walking cannoneer singing, "When It's Apple Blossom-time
in Normandie." Another rider in the column recalled
the time when his father used to give him ten
cents for standing on the bottom of an upturned tin basin
and reciting, "Over the mountains winding down, horse
and foot into Frederickstown."</p>

<p>"The jar of these guns as they grind over the gravel
is enough to grind the heart out of you," said a sweating
cannoneer who was pressing a helping shoulder to
one of the heavies as we negotiated a steep hill.</p>

<p>"What in hell you kicking about," said the man opposite.
"Suppose you was travelling with one of them
guns the Germans are using on Paris&mdash;I mean that old
John J. Longdistance. You'd know what heavy guns are
then. They say that the gun's so big and takes so many
horses to haul it, that the man who drives the lead pair
has never spent the night in the same town with the
fellow who rides wheel swing."</p>

<p>A young reserve lieutenant with mind intensely on
his work, combined for my benefit his impressions of
scenery with a lesson in artillery location. His characterisation
of the landscape was as technical as it was
unpoetical.</p>

<p>"A great howitzer country," was the tenor of his
remarks. "Look at the bottom of that slide. Fine position
for one fifty-five. Take that gully over there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
That's a beaut of a place. No use talking. Great howitzer
country."</p>

<p>During the afternoon, a veterinarian turned over two
horses to a French peasant. One was exhausted and
unable to proceed, and the other suffered a bad hoof,
which would require weeks for healing. News that both
animals were not going to be shot was received with
joy by two men who had ridden them. I saw them
patting the disabled mounts affectionately on the neck
and heard one of them say,</p>

<p>"'Salright, old timer&mdash;'salright. Frenchy here is going
to take care of you all right. Uncle Sam's paying
the bill and I am coming back and get you soon's we
give Fritzie his bumps."</p>

<p>An hour later, a young cannoneer gave in to fatigue
and ignored orders to the extent of reclining on gun
trail and falling asleep. A rut in the road made a stiff
jolt, he rolled off and one ponderous wheel of the gun
carriage passed over him. One leg, one arm and two
ribs were broken and his feet crushed, was the doctor's
verdict as the victim was carried away in an ambulance.</p>

<p>"He'll get better all right," said the medico, "but he's
finished his bit in the army."</p>

<p>The column halted for lunch outside of a small town
and I climbed on foot to the hilltop castle where
mediæval and modern were mixed in mute mélange. A
drawbridge crossed a long dry moat to cracked walls of
rock covered with ivy. For all its well preserved signs
of artistic ruin, it was occupied and well fitted within.
From the topmost parapet of one rickety looking tower,
a wire stretched out through the air to an old, ruined
mill which was surmounted by a modern wind motor,
the tail of which incongruously advertised the words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
"Ideal power," with the typical conspicuity of American
salesmanship.</p>

<p>Near the base of the old mill was another jumble of
moss-covered rocks, now used as a summer house, but
open on all sides. At a table in the centre of this open
structure, sat a blond haired young American soldier
with black receivers clamped to either ear. I approached
and watched him jotting down words on a paper pad
before him. After several minutes of intent silence, he
removed the harness from his head and told me that
he belonged to the wireless outfit with the artillery and
this station had been in operation since the day before.</p>

<p>"Seems so peaceful here with the sun streaming down
over these old walls," he said.</p>

<p>"What do you hear out of the air?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, we pick up a lot of junk," he replied, "I'm waiting
for the German communiqué now. Here's some
Spanish stuff I just picked up and some more junk in
French. The English stations haven't started this afternoon.
A few minutes ago I heard a German aeroplane
signalling by wireless to a German battery and directing
its fire. I could tell every time the gun was ordered to
fire and every time the aviator said the shot was short or
over. It's kinder funny to sit back here in quiet and
listen in the war, isn't it?" I agreed it was weird and
it was.</p>

<p>In darkness again at the end of a hard day on the
road, we parked the guns that night in a little village
which was headquarters for our regiment and where I
spent the night writing by an old oil lamp in the Mayor's
office. A former Chicago bellhop who spoke better Italian
than English and naturally should, was sleeping on
a blanket roll on the floor near me. On the walls of
the room were posted numerous flag-decked proclamations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
some now yellow with the time that had passed
over them since their issue back in 1914. They pertained
to the mobilisation of the men of the village, men whose
names remain now only as a memory.</p>

<p>But in their place was the new khaki-clad Chicago
bellhop snoring there on the floor and several thousand
more as sturdy and ready as he, all billeted within a
stone's throw of that room. They were here to finish
the fight begun by those village peasants who had
marched away four years before when the Mayor of
the town posted that bulletin. These Americans stood
ready to go down to honoured graves beside them.</p>

<p>Our division was under the French high command
and was buried in the midst of the mighty preparations
then on foot. Our ranks were full, our numbers strong,
our morale high. Every officer and man in the organisation
had the feeling that the eyes of dashing French
comrades-in-arms and hard fighting British brothers
were on them. Our inspiration was in the belief that
the attention of the Allied nations of the world and
more particularly the hope and pride of our own people
across the sea, was centred upon us. With that sacred
feeling, the first division stood resolute to meet the test.</p>

<p>Some of the disquieting news then prevalent in the
nervous civilian areas back of the lines, reached us, but
its effect, as far as I could see, was nil. Our officers
and men were as unconcerned about the reports of enemy
successes as though we were children in the nursery of
a burning house and the neighbourhood was ringing with
fire alarms. German advances before Amiens, enemy
rushes gaining gory ground in Flanders, carried no
shock to the high resolve that existed in the Allied reserves
of which we were a part.</p>

<p>Our army knew nothing but confidence. If there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
other than optimism to be derived from the current
events, then our army was inclined to consider such a
result as gratifying, because it could be calculated to
create a greater measure of speed and assistance from
the slowly functioning powers in America. The reasoning
was that any possible pessimism would hurry to the
wheel every American shoulder that had failed to take
up its individual war burden under the wave of optimism.
The army had another reason for its optimism. Our
officers knew something about the dark days that had
preceded the first battle at the Marne. They were familiar
with the gloomy outlook in 1914 that had led to
the hurried removal of the French government from
Paris to Bordeaux. Our men recalled how the enemy
was then overrunning Belgium, how the old British
"Contemptibles" were in retreat, and how the German
was within twenty miles of the French capital.</p>

<p>In that crisis had come the message by Foch and the
brilliant stroke with which he backed it up. What
followed was the tumble and collapse of the straddling
German effort and the forced transformation in the
enemy's plans from a war of six weeks to a war of four
years.</p>

<p>Our army knew the man who turned the trick at the
Marne. We knew that we were under his command,
and not the slightest doubt existed but that it was now
our destiny to take part in another play of the cards
which would call and cash the German hand. Our
forces in the coming engagements were staking their
lives, to a man, on Foch's ace in the hole.</p>

<p>That was the deadly earnestness of our army's confidence
in Foch. The capture of a hill top in Picardy
or the loss of a village in Flanders had no effect upon
that confidence. It found reinforcement in the belief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
that since March 21st, America had gained a newer and
keener appreciation of her part in the war.</p>

<p>Our army began to feel that the American people,
more than three thousand miles away from the battle
fronts, would have a better understanding of the intense
meaning that had been already conveyed in General
Pershing's words, "Confidence is needed but overconfidence
is dangerous." In other words, our soldiers in
the field began to feel that home tendencies that underrated
the enemy's strength and underestimated the effort
necessary to overcome him, had been corrected. The
army had long felt that such tendencies had made good
material for Billy Sunday's sermons and spread-eagle
speeches, but they hadn't loaded guns or placed men in
the front line.</p>

<p>We felt that this crisis had brought to America a better
realisation of the fact that Germany had not been
beaten and that she was yet to be beaten and that America's
share in the administration of that beating would
have to be greater and more determined than had heretofore
been deemed necessary. It was the hope of the
army that this realisation would reach the people with
a shock. Shocks were known to make realisations less
easy to forget. Forgetfulness from then on might have
meant Allied defeat.</p>

<p>Lagging memories found no billet in the personnel of
that First Division. Its records, registering five hundred
casualties, kept in mind the fact that the division
had seen service on the line and still had scores to settle
with the enemy.</p>

<p>Its officers and men, with but few exceptions, had
undergone their baptism in German fire and had found
the experience not distasteful. The division had esprit
which made the members of every regiment and brigade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
in it vie with the members of any other regiment and
brigade. If you had asked any enlisted man in the division,
he would have told you that his company, battery,
regiment or brigade "had it all over the rest of them."</p>

<p>That was the feeling that our division brought with
them when we marched into Picardy to meet the German
push. That was the spirit that dominated officers and
men during the ten days that we spent in man&oelig;uvres and
preparations in that concentration area in the vicinity
of the ancient town of Chaumont-en-Vexin in the department
of the Oise. It was the feeling that made us
anxious and eager to move on up to the actual front.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>UNDER FIRE</h3>


<p>On the day before our departure for the front from
the concentration area in Picardy, every officer in the
division, and they numbered almost a thousand, was
summoned to the temporary divisional headquarters,
where General Pershing addressed to them remarks
which have since become known as the commander's
"farewell to the First." We had passed out from his
command and from then on our orders were to come
from the commander of the French army to which the
division was to be attached.</p>

<p>General Pershing stood on a mound at the rear of a
beautiful château of Norman architecture, the Château
du Jard, located on the edge of the town of Chaumont-en-Vexin.
The officers ranged themselves in informal
rows on the grass. Birds were singing somewhere above
in the dense, green foliage, and sunlight was filtering
through the leaves of the giant trees.</p>

<p>The American commander spoke of the traditions
which every American soldier should remember in the
coming trials. He referred to the opportunity then
present for us, whose fathers established liberty in the
New World, now to assist the Old World in throwing off
its yoke of tyranny. Throughout this touching farewell
to the men he had trained&mdash;to his men then leaving
for scenes from which some of them would never return&mdash;the
commander's voice never betrayed the depth of
feeling behind it.</p>

<p>That night we made final arrangements for the morrow's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
move. I travelled with the artillery where orders
were received for the reduction of all packs to the
lightest possible as all men would be dismounted and the
baggage wagons would be reserved for food, ammunition
and officers' luggage only. Officers' packs, by the
same order, had to shrink from one hundred and fifty
pounds to twenty.</p>

<p>There were many misgivings that night as owners
were forced to discard cherished belongings. Cumbersome
camp paraphernalia, rubber bathtubs, pneumatic
mattresses, extra blankets, socks, sweaters, etc., all parted
company from erstwhile owners. That order caused
many a heart-break and the abandonment of thousands
of dollars' worth of personal equipment in our area.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that some of the village maidens were
surprised at the remarkable generosity of officers and
men who presented them with expensive toilet sets.
Marie at the village <i>estaminet</i> received five of them all
fitted in neat leather rolls and inscribed with as many
different sets of initials. The old men of the town
gloried in the sweaters, woollen socks and underwear.</p>

<p>There was no chance to fudge on the slim baggage
order. An officer, bound by duty, weighed each officer's
kit as it reached the baggage wagons and those tipping
the scales at more than the prescribed twenty pounds,
were thrown out entirely. I happened to be watching
the loading when it came turn for the regimental band
to stow away its encased instruments in one wagon. It
must be remembered that musicians at the front are
stretcher bearers. The baggage judge lifted the case
containing the bass horn.</p>

<p>"No horn in the world ever weighed that much," he
said. "Open it up," was the terse command. The case
was opened and the base horn pulled out. The baggage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
officer began operations on the funnel. I watched him
remove from the horn's interior two spare blankets, four
pairs of socks, an extra pair of pants and a carton of
cigarettes. He then inserted his arm up to the shoulder
in the instrument's innards and brought forth two apples,
a small tin of blackberry jam and an egg wrapped in an
undershirt.</p>

<p>The man who played the "umpah umpah" in the band
was heartbroken. The clarinet player, who had watched
the operation and whose case followed for inspection,
saved the inspector trouble by removing an easily hidden
chain of sausage. I noticed one musician who was observing
the ruthless pillage but, strangely, his countenance
was the opposite of the others. He was actually smiling.
I inquired the cause of his mirth.</p>

<p>"When we packed up, those guys with the big hollow
instruments all had the laugh on me," he said. "Now
I've got it on them. I play the piccolo."</p>

<p>All the mounted men under the rank of battery commanders
were dismounted in order to save the horses
for any possibilities in the war of movement. A dismounted
artilleryman carrying a pack and also armed
with a rifle, is a most disconsolate subject to view just
prior to setting out for a long tramp. In his opinion,
he has been reduced too near the status of the despised
doughboy.</p>

<p>It really doesn't seem like artillery unless one has a
horse to ride and a saddle to strap one's pack on. In
the lineup before we started, I saw two of these gunners
standing by weighted down with their cumbersome, unaccustomed
packs. They were backed against a stone
wall and were easing their burdens by resting the packs
on the stone ledge. Another one similarly burdened
passed and, in a most serious tone, inquired:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say, would either of you fellows like to buy another
blanket roll?" The reply of two dejected gunners
would bar this story from publication.</p>

<p>We were on the march early in the morning, but not
without some initial confusion by reason of the inevitable
higher orders which always come at the last minute to
change programmes. On parallel roads through that zone
of unmarred beauty which the Normans knew, our columns
swung along the dusty highroads.</p>

<p>There were many who held that America would not
be thoroughly awake to the full meaning of her participation
in the war until the day there came back from
the battlefields a long list of casualties&mdash;a division wiped
out or decimated. Many had heard the opinions expressed
in France and many firmly believed that nothing
short of such a shock would arouse our nation to the
exertion of the power and speed necessary to save the
Allied cause from defeat.</p>

<p>On this march, that thought recurred to some and
perhaps to many who refrained soberly from placing it
in words. I knew several in the organisation who felt
that we were on our way to that sacrifice. I can not estimate
in how many minds the thought became tangible,
but among several whom I heard seriously discussing the
matter, I found a perfect willingness on their part to
meet the unknown&mdash;to march on to the sacrifice with
the feeling that if the loss of their life would help bring
about a greater prosecution of the war by our country,
then they would not have died in vain.</p>

<p>If this was the underlying spirit, it had no effect
whatever upon outward appearances which could hardly
be better described than with Cliff Raymond's lilting
words: "There are roses in their rifles just the same." If
this move was on to the sacrifice&mdash;if death awaited at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the end of the road, then those men were marching
toward it with a song.</p>

<p>It takes a hard march to test the morale of soldiers.
When the feet are road-sore, when the legs ache from
the endless pounding of hobnails on hard macadam,
when the pack straps cut and burn to the shoulder blades,
and the tin hat weighs down like a crown of thorns,
then keep your ear open for a jest and if your hearing
is rewarded, you will know that you march with men.</p>

<p>Many times that first day, those jests came to enliven
dejected spirits and put smiles on sweat-rinsed faces. I
recall our battery as it negotiated the steep hills. When
the eight horses attached to the gun carriages were
struggling to pull them up the incline, a certain subaltern
with a voice slow, but damnably insistent, would sing
out, "Cannoneers, to the wheels." This reiterated command
at every grade forced aching shoulders already
weary with their own burdens to strain behind the heavy
carriages and ease the pull on the animals.</p>

<p>Once on a down grade, our way crossed the
tracks of a narrow gauge railroad. Not far from the
crossing could be seen a dinky engine puffing and snorting
furiously in terrific effort to move up the hill its attached
train of loaded ammunition cars. The engine
was having a hard fight when some light-hearted weary
one in our column gave voice to something which brought
up the smile.</p>

<p>"Cannoneers, to the wheel!" was the shout and even
the dignified subaltern whose pet command was the butt
of the exclamation, joined in the wave of laughs that
went down the line.</p>

<p>An imposing château of the second empire now presided
over by an American heiress, the wife of a French
officer, was regimental headquarters that night. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
barns and outbuildings were the cleanest in France according
to individuals who had slept in so many barns
that they feel qualified to judge.</p>

<p>"Painfully sanitary," said a young lieutenant, who
remarked that the tile floor might make a stable smell
sweeter but it hardly offered the slumbering possibilities
of a straw shakedown. While the men arranged their
blankets in those quarters, the horses grazed and rolled
in green paddocks fenced with white painted rails. The
cooks got busy with the evening meal and the men off
duty started exploring the two nearby villages.</p>

<p>For the American soldier, financial deals were always
a part of these explorations. It was seldom more than
an hour after his arrival in a populated village before
the stock market and board of trade were in full operation.
These mobile establishments usually were set up
in the village square if headquarters did not happen to
be located too close. There were plenty to play the
rôles of bulls and bears; there was much bidding and
shouting of quotations.</p>

<p>The dealings were not in bushels of wheat or shares
in oils or rails. Delicacies were the bartered commodities
and of these, eggs were the strongest. The German
intelligence service could have found no surer way to
trace the peregrinations of American troops about France,
than to follow up the string of eggless villages they left
behind them.</p>

<p>As soon as billets were located, those without extra
duty began the egg canvass of the town. There was
success for those who made the earliest start and struck
the section with the most prolific hens. Eggs were
bought at various prices before news of the American
arrivals had caused peasants to set up a new scale of
charges. The usual late starter and the victim of arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
was the officer's striker who lost valuable
time by having to take care of his officer's luggage and
get the latter established in billets. It was then his duty
to procure eggs for the officer's mess.</p>

<p>By that time, all natural egg sources had been obliterated
and the only available supply was cornered by the
soldiers' board of trade. The desired breakfast food
could be obtained in that place only. It was the last
and only resort of the striker, who is euphoniously known
as a dog robber. In the board of trade he would find
soldiers with helmets full of eggs which could be bought
at anywhere from two to three times their original price.
It was only by the payment of such prices that the officer
was able to get anything that could possibly leave a
trace of yellow on his chin. If there was a surplus, the
soldiers themselves had ample belt room to accommodate
it.</p>

<p>In one village tavern, I saw one soldier eat fourteen
eggs which he ordered Madame to fry in succession. I
can believe it because I saw it. Madame saw it also,
but I feel that she did not believe her eyes. A captain
of the Judge Advocate's office also witnessed the gastronomic
feat.</p>

<p>"Every one of those eggs was bought and paid for,"
he said. "Our department handles claims for all stolen
or destroyed property and we have yet to receive the
first claim from this town. Of course every one knows
that a hungry man will steal to eat and there are those
who hold that theft for the purpose of satisfying demands
of the stomach is not theft. But our records
show that the American soldier in France is ready to,
willing to, and capable of buying what he needs outside
of his ration allowance.</p>

<p>"We have some instances of stealing, but most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
them are trivial. Recently, we took from the pay of
one whole battalion the cost of thirty-one cheeses which
were taken from a railroad restaurant counter. The
facts were that some of our troops en route were hungry
and the train was stopping only for five minutes and
the woman behind the counter didn't have time to even
take, much less change, the money offered, so the men
grabbed the cheeses and ran out just in time to board the
train as it was moving off.</p>

<p>"There was one case, though, in which Uncle Sam
didn't have the heart to charge any one. He paid the
bill himself and maybe if you could send the story back
home, the citizens who paid it would get a laugh worth
the money. It happened during a recent cold spell when
some of our troops were coming from seaboard to the
interior. They travelled in semi-opened horse cars and
it was cold, damn cold.</p>

<p>"One of the trains stopped in front of a small railroad
station and six soldiers with cold hands and feet
jumped from the car and entered the waiting room, in
the centre of which was a large square coal stove with
red hot sides. One man stood on another one's shoulders
and disjointed the stove pipe. At the same time, two
others placed poles under the bottom of the stove, lifted
it off the floor and walked out of the room with it.</p>

<p>"They placed it in the horse car, stuck the pipe out
of one door and were warm for the remainder of the
trip. It was the first time in the history of that little
village that anybody had ever stolen a red hot stove.
The French government, owning the railroads, made
claim against us for four hundred francs for the stove
and eleven francs' worth of coal in it. Uncle Sam paid
the bill and was glad to do it.</p>

<p>"I know of only one case to beat that one and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
concerned an infantryman who stole a hive full of honey
and took the bees along with it. The medical department
handled one aspect of the case and the provost
marshal the other. The bees meted out some of the
punishment and we stung his pay for the costs."</p>

<p>There was one thing, however, that men on the move
found it most difficult to steal and that was sleep. So
at least it seemed the next morning when we swung
into the road at daybreak and continued our march into
the north. Much speculation went the rounds as to our
destination. The much debated question was as to
whether our forces would be incorporated with Foch's
reserve armies and held in readiness for a possible
counter offensive, or whether we should be placed in one
of the line armies and assigned to holding a position in
the path of the German push. But all this conjecture
resulted in nothing more than passing the time. Our
way led over byroads and side lanes which the French
master of circulation had laid down for us.</p>

<p>Behind an active front, the French sanctified their
main roads and reserved them for the use of fast motor
traffic and the rushing up of supplies or reserves in cases
of necessity. Thousands of poilus too old for combat
duty did the repair work on these main arteries. All
minor and slow moving traffic was side-tracked to keep
the main line clear. At times we were forced to cross
the main highroads and then we encountered the forward
and backward stream of traffic to and from the front.
At one of those intersections, I sought the grass bank at
the side of the road for rest. Two interesting actors in
this great drama were there before me. One was an
American soldier wearing a blue brassard with the white
letters M. P. He was a military policeman on duty as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
road marker whose function is to regulate traffic and
prevent congestion.</p>

<p>Beside him was seated a peculiar looking person whose
knee length skirts of khaki exposed legs encased in wrap
puttees. A motor coat of yellow leather and the visored
cap of a British Tommy completed the costume. The
hair showing beneath the crown of the cap was rather
long and straight, but betrayed traces of having been
recently close cropped. For all her masculine appearance,
she was French and the young road marker was
lavishing upon her everything he had gleaned in a
Freshman year of French in a Spokane high school.</p>

<p>I offered my cigarette case and was surprised when
the girl refrained. That surprise increased when I saw
her extract from a leather case of her own a full fledged
black cigar which she proceeded to light and smoke with
gusto. When I expressed my greater surprise, she increased
it by shrugging her shoulders prettily, plunging
one gauntleted hand into a side pocket and producing
a pipe with a pouch of tobacco.</p>

<p>There was nothing dainty about that pipe. It had
no delicate amber stem nor circlet of filigree gold.
There was no meerschaum ornamentation. It was just
a good old Jimmy pipe with a full-grown cake in the
black burnt bowl, and a well bitten, hard rubber mouth
piece. It looked like one of those that father used to
consent to have boiled once a year, after mother had
charged it with rotting the lace curtains. If war makes
men of peace-time citizens, then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But she was a girl and her name was Yvonne. The
red-winged letter on her coat lapel placed her in the automobile
service and the motor ambulance stationed at the
road side explained her special branch of work. She
inquired the meaning of my correspondent's insignia and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
then explained that she had drawn pastelles for a Paris
publication before the war, but had been transporting
<i>blessés</i> since. The French lesson proceeded and Spokane
Steve and I learned from her that the longest word
in the French language is spelled "Anticonstitutionellement."
I expressed the hope that some day both of us
would be able to pronounce it.</p>

<p>On the girl's right wrist was a silver chain bracelet
with identification disk. In response to our interested
gaze, she exhibited it to us, and upon her own volition,
informed us that she was a descendant of the same family
as Jeanne d'Arc. Steve heard and winked to me with
a remark that they couldn't pull any stuff like that on anybody
from Spokane, because he had never heard that
that Maid of Orleans had been married. Yvonne must
have understood the last word because she explained
forthwith that she had not claimed direct descendence
from the famous Jeanne, but from the same family.
Steve looked her in the eye and said, "Jay compraw."</p>

<p>She explained the meaning of the small gold and silver
medals suspended from the bracelet. She detached two
and presented them to us. One of them bore in relief
the image of a man in flowing robes carrying a child on
his shoulder, and the reverse depicted a tourist driving
a motor through hilly country.</p>

<p>"That is St. Christophe," said Yvonne. "He is the
patron saint of travellers. His medal is good luck
against accidents on the road. Here is one of St. Elias.
He is the new patron saint of the aviators. You remember.
Didn't he go to heaven in a fiery chariot, or
fly up on golden wings or something like that? Anyhow,
all the aviators wear one of his medals."</p>

<p>St. Christophe was attached to my identification disk.
Steve declared infantrymen travelled too slowly ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
to have anything happen to them and that he was going
to give his to a friend who drove a truck. When I fell
in line with the next passing battery and moved down the
road, Spokane Steve and the Yvonne of the family of
Jeanne had launched into a discussion of prize fighting
and chewing tobacco.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In billets that night, in a village not far from Beauvais,
the singing contest for the prize of fifty dollars offered
by the battalion commander Major Robert R. McCormick
was resumed with intense rivalry between the
tenors and basses of batteries A and B. A "B" Battery
man was croaking Annie Laurie, when an "A" Battery
booster in the audience remarked audibly,</p>

<p>"Good Lord, I'd rather hear first call." First call is
the bugle note that disturbs sleep and starts the men on
the next day's work.</p>

<p>A worried lieutenant found me in the crowd around
the rolling kitchen and inquired:</p>

<p>"Do you know whether there's a provost guard on
that inn down the road?" I couldn't inform him, but
inquired the reason for his alarm.</p>

<p>"I've got a hunch that the prune juice is running knee
deep to-night," he replied, "and I don't want any of
my section trying to march to-morrow with swelled
heads."</p>

<p>"Prune juice" is not slang. It is a veritable expression
and anybody who thinks that the favourite of the
boarding house table cannot produce a fermented article
that is <i>très fort</i> in the way of a throat burner, is greatly
mistaken. In France the fermented juice of the prune
is called "water of life," but it carries a "dead to the
world" kick. The simple prune, which the army used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
to call "native son" by reason of its California origin,
now ranks with its most inebriating sisters of the vine.</p>

<p>The flow of <i>eau de vie</i> must have been dammed at the
inn. On the road the next day, I saw a mule driver
wearing a sixteen candle power black eye. When I inquired
the source of the lamp shade, he replied:</p>

<p>"This is my first wound in the war of movement. Me
and the cop had an offensive down in that town that's
spelt like Sissors but you say it some other way." I
knew he was thinking of Gisors.</p>

<p>The third and fourth day's march brought us into
regions nearer the front, where the movement of refugees
on the roads seemed greater, where the roll of the
guns came constantly from the north, where enemy motors
droned through the air on missions of frightfulness.</p>

<p>There was a major in our regiment whose knowledge
of French was confined to the single affirmative exclamation,
"Ah, oui." He worked this expression constantly
in the French conversation with a refugee woman from
the invaded districts. She with her children occupied
one room in the cottage. When the major started to
leave, two days later, the refugee woman addressed him
in a reproving tone and with tears. He could only reply
with sympathetic "Ah, oui's," which seemed to make
her all the more frantic.</p>

<p>An interpreter straightened matters out by informing
the major that the woman wanted to know why he was
leaving without getting her furniture.</p>

<p>"What furniture?" replied the puzzled major.</p>

<p>"Why, she says," said the interpreter, "that you
promised her you would send three army trucks to her
house back of the German lines and bring all of her household
goods to this side of the line. She says that she explained
all of it to you and you said, 'Ah, oui.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>The major has since abandoned the "ah, oui" habit.</p>

<p>At one o'clock one morning, orders reached the battalion
for reconnaissance detail; each battery to be ready
to take road by daylight. We were off at break of day
in motor trucks with a reel cart of telephone wire
hitched on behind. Thirty minutes later we rumbled
along roads under range of German field pieces and
arrived in a village designated as battalion headquarters
to find that we were first to reach the sector allotted for
American occupation. The name of the town was
Serevilliers.</p>

<p>Our ears did not delude us about the activity of the
sector, but I found that officers and men of the detail
were inclined to accept the heavy shelling in a non-committal
manner until a French interpreter attached
to us remarked that artillery action in the sector was as
intense as any he had experienced at Verdun.</p>

<p>If the ever present crash of shells reminded us that
we were opposite the peak of the German push, there
was plenty of work to engage minds that might otherwise
have paid too much attention to the dangers of their
location. A chalk cellar with a vaulted ceiling and
ventilators, unfortunately opening on the enemy side of
the upper structure, was selected as the battalion command
post. The men went to work immediately to
remove piles of dirty billeting straw under which was
found glass, china, silverware and family portraits, all
of which had been hurriedly buried by the owners of the
house not two weeks before.</p>

<p>While linemen planned communications, and battery
officers surveyed gun positions, the battalion commander
and two orienting officers went forward to the frontal
zone to get the first look at our future targets and establish
observation posts from which our firing could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
directed. I accompanied the small party, which was led
by a French officer familiar with the sector. It was upon
his advice that we left the roads and took cuts across
fields, avoiding the path and road intersections and taking
advantage of any shelter offered by the ground.</p>

<p>Virgin fields on our way bore the enormous craters
left by the explosion of poorly directed German shells of
heavy calibre. Orders were to throw ourselves face
downward upon the ground upon the sound of each approaching
missile. There is no text book logic on judging
from the sound of a shell whether it has your address
written on it, but it is surprising how quick that education
may be obtained by experience. Several hours of
walking and dropping to the ground resulted in an attuning
of the ears which made it possible to judge approximately
whether that oncoming, whining, unseen
thing from above would land dangerously near or
ineffectively far from us. The knowledge was common
to all of us and all of our ears were keenly tuned for the
sounds. Time after time the collective judgment and
consequent prostration of the entire party was proven
well timed by the arrival of a shell uncomfortably close.</p>

<p>We gained a wooded hillside that bristled with busy
French seventy-fives, which the German tried in vain
to locate with his howitzer fire. We mounted a forest
plateau, in the centre of which a beautiful white château
still held out against the enemy's best efforts to locate it
with his guns. One shell addressed in this special direction
fortunately announced its coming with such unmistakable
vehemence that our party all landed in the same
shell hole at once.</p>

<p>Every head was down when the explosion came.
Branches and pieces of tree trunk were whirled upward,
and the air became populated with deadly bumble bees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
and humming birds, for such is the sound that the shell
splinters make. When I essayed our shell hole afterward,
I couldn't fathom how five of us had managed to
accommodate ourselves in it, but in the rush of necessity,
no difficulty had been found.</p>

<p>Passing from the woods forward, one by one, over
a bald field, we skirted a village that was being heavily
shelled, and reached a trench on the side of the hill in
direct view of the German positions. The enemy partially
occupied the ruined village of Cantigny not eight
hundred yards away, but our glasses were unable to
pick up the trace of a single person in the débris. French
shells, arriving endlessly in the village, shot geysers of
dust and wreckage skyward. It was from this village,
several days later, that our infantry patrols brought in
several prisoners, all of whom were suffering from shell
shock. But our men in the village opposite underwent
the same treatment at the hands of the German artillery.</p>

<p>It was true of this sector that what corresponded to
the infantry front line was a much safer place to be in
than in the reserve positions, or about the gun pits in
villages or along roads in our back area. Front line
activity was something of minor consideration, as both
sides seemed to have greater interests at other points
and, in addition to that, the men of both sides were busy
digging trenches and shelters. There were numerous
machine gun posts which swept with lead the indeterminate
region between the lines, and at night, patrols
from both sides explored as far as possible the holdings
of the other side.</p>

<p>Returning to the battalion headquarters that night by
a route apparently as popular to German artillery as was
the one we used in the forenoon, we found a telephone
switchboard in full operation in the sub-cellar, and mess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
headquarters established in a clean kitchen above the
ground. Food was served in the kitchen and we noticed
that one door had suffered some damage which had
caused it to be boarded up and that the plaster ceiling of
the room was full of fresh holes and rents in a dozen
places. At every shock to the earth, a little stream of
oats would come through the holes from the attic above.
These falling down on the officer's neck in the midst of
a meal, would have no effect other than causing him to
call for his helmet to ward off the cereal rain.</p>

<p>We learned more about the sinister meaning of that
broken door and the ceiling holes when it became necessary
later in the evening to move mess to a safer location.
The kitchen was located just thirty yards back of
the town cross roads and an unhealthy percentage of
German shells that missed the intersection caused too
much interruption in our cook's work.</p>

<p>We found that the mess room was vacant by reason
of the fact that it had become too unpleasant for French
officers, who had relinquished it the day before. We
followed their suite and were not surprised when an
infantry battalion mess followed us into the kitchen and
just one day later, to the hour, followed us out of it.</p>

<p>Lying on the floor in that chalk cellar that night and
listening to the pound of arriving shells on nearby cross
roads and battery positions, we estimated how long it
would be before this little village would be completely
levelled to the ground. Already gables were disappearing
from houses, sturdy chimneys were toppling and
stone walls were showing jagged gaps. One whole wall
of the village school had crumbled before one blast, so
that now the wooden desks and benches of the pupils and
their books and papers were exposed to view from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
street. On the blackboard was a penmanship model
which read:</p>

<p>"Let no day pass without having saved something."</p>

<p>An officer came down the dark stone steps into the
cellar, kicked off his boots and lay down on some blankets
in one corner.</p>

<p>"I just heard some shells come in that didn't explode,"
I remarked. "Do you know whether they were gas or
duds?"</p>

<p>"I don't know whether they were gas or not," he said,
"but I do know that that horse out in the yard is certainly
getting ripe."</p>

<p>The defunct animal referred to occupied an uncovered
grave adjoining our ventilator. Sleeping in a gas mask
was not the most unpleasant form of slumber.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>BEFORE CANTIGNY</h3>


<p>It is strange how sleep can come at the front in surroundings
not unlike the interior of a boiler factory, but
it does. I heard of no man who slept in the cellars beneath
the ruins of Serevilliers that night being disturbed
by the pounding of the shells and the jar of the ground,
both of which were ever present through our dormant
senses. Stranger still was the fact that at midnight
when the shelling almost ceased, for small intervals,
almost every sleeper there present was aroused by the
sudden silence. When the shelling was resumed, sleep
returned.</p>

<p>"When I get back on the farm outside of Chicago,"
said one officer, "I don't believe I will be able to sleep
unless I get somebody to stand under my window and
shake a thunder sheet all night."</p>

<p>It is also remarkable how the tired human, under such
conditions, can turn off the switch on an energetic imagination
and resign himself completely to fate. In those
cellars that night, every man knew that one direct hit
of a "two ten" German shell on his particular cellar
wall, would mean taps for everybody in the cave. Such
a possibility demands consideration in the slowest moving
minds.</p>

<p>Mentalities and morale of varying calibre cogitate upon
this matter at varying lengths, but I doubt in the end
if there is much difference in the conclusion arrived at.
Such reflections produce the inevitable decision that
if one particular shell is coming into your particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
abode, there is nothing you can do to keep it out, so
"What the hell!" You might just as well go to sleep
and forget it because if it gets you, you most probably
will never know anything about it anyway. I believe
such is the philosophy of the shelled.</p>

<p>It must have been three o'clock in the morning when
a sputtering motor cycle came to a stop in the shelter
of our cellar door and a gas guard standing there exchanged
words with some one. It ended in the sound of
hobnails on the stone steps as the despatch rider descended,
lighting his way with the yellow shaft from an
electric pocket lamp.</p>

<p>"What is it?" inquired the Major, awakening and rolling
over on his side.</p>

<p>"Just come from regimental headquarters," said the
messenger. "I'm carrying orders on to the next town.
Adjutant gave me this letter to deliver to you, sir. The
Adjutant's compliments, sir, and apologies for waking
you, but he said the mail just arrived and the envelope
looked important and he thought you might like to get
it right away."</p>

<p>"Hmm," said the Major, weighing the official looking
envelope in one hand and observing both the American
stamps in one corner and numerous addresses to which
the missive had been forwarded. He tore off one end
and extracted a sheet which he unfolded and read while
the messenger waited at his request. I was prepared to
hear of a promotion order from Washington and made
ready to offer congratulations. The Major smiled and
tossed the paper over to me, at the same time reaching
for a notebook and fountain pen.</p>

<p>"Hold a light for me," he said to the messenger as he
sat on the edge of the bed and began writing. "This is
urgent and I will make answer now. You will mail it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
at regimental headquarters." As his pen scratched
across the writing pad, I read the letter he had just received.
The stationery bore the heading of an alumni
association of a well-known eastern university. The
contents ran as follows:</p>

<p class='blockquot'>"Dear Sir: What are you doing for your country?
What are you doing to help win the war? While our
brave boys are in France facing the Kaiser's shell and
gas, the alumni association has directed me as secretary
to call upon all the old boys of the university and invite
them to do their bit for Uncle Sam's fighting men. We
ask your subscription to a fund which we are raising to
send cigarettes to young students of the university who
are now serving with the colours and who are so nobly
maintaining the traditions of our Alma Mater. Please
fill out the enclosed blank, stating your profession and
present occupation. Fraternally yours, &mdash;&mdash; Secretary."</p>

<p>The Major was watching me with a smile as I concluded
reading.</p>

<p>"Here's my answer," he said, reading from a notebook
leaf:</p>

<p class='blockquot'>"Your letter reached me to-night in a warm little
village in France. With regard to my present profession,
will inform you that I am an expert in ammunition
trafficking and am at present occupied in exporting
large quantities of shells to Germany over the air route.

to best the Kaiser. &mdash;&mdash;, Major. &mdash;&mdash; Field
Artillery, U. S. A. On front in France."</p>

<p>"I guess that ought to hold them," said the Major
as he folded the letter and addressed an envelope. It
rather seemed to me that it would but before I could
finish the remark, the Major was back asleep in his
blankets.</p>

<p>By daylight, I explored the town, noting the havoc
wrought by the shells that had arrived in the night. I
had thought in seeing refugees moving southward along
the roads, that there was little variety of articles related
to human existence that they failed to carry away with
them. But one inspection of the abandoned abodes of
the unfortunate peasants of Serevilliers was enough to
convince me of the greater variety of things that had
to be left behind. Old people have saving habits and
the French peasants pride themselves upon never throwing
anything away.</p>

<p>The cottage rooms were littered with the discarded
clothing of all ages, discarded but saved. Old shoes and
dresses, ceremonial high hats and frock coats, brought
forth only for weddings or funerals, were mixed on the
floor with children's toys, prayer books and broken china.
Shutters and doors hung aslant by single hinges. In the
village <i>estaminet</i> much mud had been tracked in by exploring
feet and the red tiled floor was littered with straw
and pewter measuring mugs, dear to the heart of the
antiquary.</p>

<p>The ivory balls were gone from the dust covered billiard
table, but the six American soldiers billeted in the
cellar beneath had overcome this discrepancy. They enjoyed
after dinner billiards just the same with three
large wooden balls from a croquet court in the garden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
A croquet ball is a romping substitute when it hits the
green cushions.</p>

<p>That afternoon we laid more wire across fields to the
next town to the north. Men who do this job are, in
my opinion, the most daring in any organisation that
depends for efficiency upon uninterrupted telephone communication.
For them, there is no shelter when a
deluge of shells pours upon a field across which their
wire is laid. Without protection of any kind from the
flying steel splinters, they must go to that spot to repair
the cut wires and restore communication. During one
of these shelling spells, I reached cover of the road side
<i>abri</i> and prepared to await clearer weather.</p>

<p>In the distance, down the road, appeared a scudding
cloud of dust. An occasional shell dropping close on
either side of the road seemed to add speed to the apparition.
As it drew closer, I could see that it was a motor
cycle of the three wheeled bathtub variety. The rider
on the cycle was bending close over his handle bars and
apparently giving her all there was in her, but the bulky
figure that filled to overflowing the side car, rode with
his head well back.</p>

<p>At every irregularity in the road, the bathtub contraption
bounced on its springs, bow and stern rising
and falling like a small ship in a rough sea. Its nearer
approach revealed that the giant torso apparent above its
rim was encased in a double breasted khaki garment
which might have marked the wearer as either the master
of a four in hand or a Mississippi steamboat of the antebellum
type. The enormous shoulders, thus draped,
were surmounted by a huge head, which by reason of its
rigid, backward, star-gazing position appeared mostly as
chin and double chin. The whole was topped by a huge
fat cigar which sprouted upward from the elevated chin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
and at times gave forth clouds like the forward smoke-stack
on the <i>Robert E. Lee</i>.</p>

<p>I was trying to decide in my mind whether the elevated
chin posture of the passenger was the result of
pride, bravado or a boil on the Adam's apple, when the
scudding comet reached the shelter of the protecting bank
in which was located the chiselled dog kennel that I
occupied. As the machine came to halt, the superior
chin depressed itself ninety degrees, and brought into
view the smiling features of that smile-making gentleman
from Paducah&mdash;Mr. Irvin S. Cobb. Machine,
rider and passenger stopped for breath and I made bold
to ask the intrepid humourist if he suffered from a too
keen sense of smell or a saw edge collar.</p>

<p>"I haven't a sensitive nose, a saw edge collar or an
inordinate admiration for clouds," the creator of Judge
Priest explained with reference to his former stiff-necked
pose, "but George here," waving to the driver,
"took a sudden inspiration for fast movement. The
jolt almost took my head off and the wind kept me from
getting it back into position. George stuck his spurs
into this here flying bootblack stand just about the time
something landed near us that sounded like a kitchen
stove half loaded with window weights and window
panes. I think George made a record for this road.
I've named it Buh-Looey Boulevard."</p>

<p>When the strafing subsided we parted and I reached
the next deserted town without incident. It was almost
the vesper hour or what had been the allotted time for
that rite in those parts when I entered the yard of the
village church, located in an exposed position at a cross
roads on the edge of the town. A sudden unmistakable
whirr sounded above and I threw myself on the ground
just as the high velocity, small calibre German shell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
registered a direct hit on the side of the nave where roof
and wall met.</p>

<p>While steel splinters whistled through the air, an
avalanche of slate tiles slid down the slanting surface of
the roof, and fell in a clattering cascade on the graves
in the yard below. I sought speedy shelter in the lee of
a tombstone. Several other shells had struck the churchyard
and one of them had landed on the final resting place
of the family of Roger La Porte. The massive marble
slab which had sealed the top of the sunken vault had
been heaved aside and one wall was shattered, leaving
open to the gaze a cross section view of eight heavy
caskets lying in an orderly row.</p>

<p>Nearby were fresh mounds of yellow earth, surmounted
by now unpainted wooden crosses on which
were inscribed in pencil the names of French soldiers
with dates, indicating that their last sacrifice for the
tri-colour of la Patria had been made ten days prior.
In the soil at the head of each grave, an ordinary beer
bottle had been planted neck downward, and through
the glass one could see the paper scroll on which the
name, rank and record of the dead man was preserved.
While I wondered at this prosaic method of identification,
an American soldier came around the corner of
the church, lighted a cigarette and sat down on an old
tombstone.</p>

<p>"Stick around if you want to hear something good,"
he said, "That is if that last shell didn't bust the organ.
There's a French poilu who has come up here every
afternoon at five o'clock for the last three days and he
plays the sweetest music on the organ. It certainly is
great. Reminds me of when I was an altar boy, back
in St. Paul."</p>

<p>We waited and soon there came from the rickety old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
organ loft the soothing tones of an organ. The ancient
pipes, sweetened by the benedictions of ages, poured
forth melody to the touch of one whose playing was
simple, but of the soul. We sat silently among the
graves as the rays of the dying sun brought to life new
colouring in the leaded windows of stained glass behind
which a soldier of France swayed at the ivory keyboard
and with heavenly harmony ignored those things of
death and destruction that might arrive through the air
any minute.</p>

<p>My companion informed me that the poilu at the
organ wore a uniform of horizon blue which marked
him as casual to this village, whose French garrisons
were Moroccans with the distinctive khaki worn by all
French colonials in service. The sign of the golden
crescent on their collar tabs identified them as children
of Mahomet and one would have known as much anyway
upon seeing the use to which the large crucifix
standing in what was the market place had been put.</p>

<p>So as not to impede traffic through the place, it had
become necessary to elevate the field telephone wires
from the ground and send them across the road overhead.
The crucifix in the centre of the place had presented
itself as excellent support for this wire and the
sons of the prophet had utilised it with no intention of
disrespect. The uplifted right knee of the figure on the
cross was insulated and wired. War, the moderniser
and mocker of Christ, seemed to have devised new pain
for the Teacher of Peace. The crucifixion had become
the electrocution.</p>

<p>At the foot of the cross had been nailed a rudely made
sign conveying to all who passed the French warning
that this was an exposed crossing and should be negotiated
rapidly. Fifty yards away another board bore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the red letters R. A. S. and by following the direction
indicated by arrows, one arrived at the cellar in which
the American doctor had established a Relief Aid Station.
The Medico had furnished his subterranean apartments
with furniture removed from the house above.</p>

<p>"Might as well bring it down here and make the
boys comfortable," he said, "as to leave it up there and
let shells make kindling out of it. Funny thing about
these cellars. Ones with western exposure&mdash;that is,
with doors and ventilators opening on the side away
from the enemy seem scarcest. That seems to have been
enough to have revived all that talk about German
architects having had something to do with the erection
of those buildings before the war. You remember at
one time it was said that a number of houses on the
front had been found to have plaster walls on the side
nearest the enemy and stone walls on the other side.
There might be something to it, but I doubt it."</p>

<p>Across the street an American battalion headquarters
had been established on the first floor and in the basement
of the house, which appeared the most pretentious
in the village. Telephone wires now entered the building
through broken window panes, and within maps had been
tacked to plaster walls and the furniture submitted to
the hard usage demanded by war. An old man conspicuous
by his civilian clothes wandered about the yard
here and there, picking up some stray implement or
nick-nack, hanging it up on a wall or placing it carefully
aside.</p>

<p>"There's a tragedy," the battalion commander told me.
"That man is mayor of this town. He was forced to flee
with the rest of the civilians. He returned to-day to look
over the ruins. This is his house we occupy. I explained
that much of it is as we found it, but that we undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
have broken some things. I could see that every broken
chair and window and plate meant a heart throb to him,
but he only looked up at me with his wrinkled old face and
smiled as he said, 'It is all right, Monsieur. I understand.
<i>C'est la guerre.</i>'"</p>

<p>The old man opened one of his barn doors, revealing a
floor littered with straw and a fringe of hobnailed American
boots. A night-working detail was asleep in blankets.
A sleepy voice growled out something about closing the
door again and the old man with a polite, "<i>Pardonnez-moi,
messieurs</i>," swung the wooden portal softly shut. His
home&mdash;his house&mdash;his barn&mdash;his straw&mdash;<i>c'est la guerre</i>.</p>

<p>An evening meal of "corn willy" served on some of
the Mayor's remaining chinaware, was concluded by a
final course of fresh spring onions. These came from
the Mayor's own garden just outside the door. As the
cook affirmed, it was no difficulty to gather them.</p>

<p>"Every night Germans drop shells in the garden," he
said. "I don't even have to pull 'em. Just go out in the
morning and pick 'em up off the ground."</p>

<p>I spent part of the night in gun pits along the road
side, bordering the town. This particular battery of heavies
was engaged on a night long programme of interdiction
fire laid down with irregular intensity on cross roads
and communication points in the enemy's back areas.
Under screens of camouflage netting, these howitzers with
mottled bores squatting frog-like on their carriages, intermittently
vomited flame, red, green and orange. The detonations
were ear-splitting and cannoneers relieved the
recurring shocks by clapping their hands to the sides of
their head and balancing on the toes each time the lanyard
was pulled.</p>

<p>Infantry reserves were swinging along in the road
directly in back of the guns. They were moving up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
forward positions and they sang in an undertone as they
moved in open order.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Glor&mdash;ree&mdash;us, Glor&mdash;ree&mdash;us!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One keg of beer for the four of us.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glory be to Mike there are no more of us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For four of us can drink it all alone."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Some of these marchers would come during an interval
of silence to a position on the road not ten feet from
a darkened, camouflaged howitzer just as it would shatter
the air with a deafening crash. The suddenness and
unexpectedness of the detonation would make the marchers
start and jump involuntarily. Upon such occasions,
the gun crews would laugh heartily and indulge in good
natured raillery with the infantrymen.</p>

<p>"Whoa, Johnny Doughboy, don't you get frightened.
We were just shipping a load of sauerkraut to the
Kaiser," said one ear-hardened gunner. "Haven't you
heard the orders against running your horses? Come
down to a gallop and take it easy."</p>

<p>"Gwan, you leatherneck," returns an infantryman,
"You smell like a livery stable. Better trade that pitchfork
for a bayonet and come on up where there's some
fighting."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about the fighting, little doughboy,"
came another voice from the dark gun pit. "This is a
tray forte sector. If you don't get killed the first eight
days, the orders is to shoot you for loafing. You're
marching over what's called 'the road you don't come
back on.'"</p>

<p>A train of ammunition trucks, timed to arrive at the
moment when the road was unoccupied, put in appearance
as the end of the infantry column passed, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
captain in charge urged the men on to speedy unloading
and fumed over delays by reason of darkness. The men
received big shells in their arms and carried them to the
roadside dumps where they were piled in readiness for
the guns. The road was in an exposed position and this
active battery was liable to draw enemy fire at any time,
so the ammunition train captain was anxious to get his
charges away in a hurry.</p>

<p>His fears were not without foundation, because in the
midst of the unloading, one German missile arrived in a
nearby field and sprayed the roadway with steel just as
every one flattened out on the ground. Five ammunition
hustlers arose with minor cuts and one driver was swearing
at the shell fragment which had gone through the
radiator of his truck and liberated the water contents.
The unloading was completed with all speed, and the
ammunition train moved off, towing a disabled truck.
With some of the gunners who had helped in unloading,
I crawled into the chalk dugout to share sleeping quarters
in the straw.</p>

<p>"What paper do you represent?" one man asked me as
he sat in the straw, unwrapping his puttees. I told him.</p>

<p>"Do you want to know the most popular publication
around this place?" he asked, and I replied affirmatively.</p>

<p>"It's called the <i>Daily Woollen Undershirt</i>," he said.
"Haven't you seen everybody sitting along the roadside
reading theirs and trying to keep up with things? Believe
me, it's some reading-matter, too."</p>

<p>"Don't let him kid you," said the section chief, "I
haven't had to read mine yet. The doctor fixed up the
baths in town and yesterday he passed around those flea
charms. Have you seen them?"</p>

<p>For our joint inspection there was passed the string
necklace with two linen tabs soaked in aromatic oil of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
cedar, while the section chief gave an impromptu lecture
on personal sanitation. It was concluded by a peremptory
order from without for extinction of all lights.
The candle stuck on the helmet top was snuffed and we
lay down in darkness with the guns booming away on
either side.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Our positions were located in a country almost as new
to war as were the fields of Flanders in the fall of '14.
A little over a month before it had all been peaceful
farming land, far behind the belligerent lines. Upon our
arrival, its sprouting fields of late wheat and oats were
untended and bearing their first harvest of shell craters.</p>

<p>The abandoned villages now occupied by troops told
once more the mute tales of the homeless. The villagers,
old men, old women and children, had fled, driving before
them their cows and farm animals even as they
themselves had been driven back by the train of German
shells. In their deserted cottages remained the fresh
traces of their departure and the ruthless rupturing of
home ties, generations old.</p>

<p>On every hand were evidences of the reborn war of
semi-movement. One day I would see a battery of light
guns swing into position by a roadside, see an observing
officer mount by ladder to a tree top and direct the firing
of numberless rounds into the rumbling east. By the
next morning, they would have changed position, rumbled
off to other parts, leaving beside the road only the marks
of their cannon wheels and mounds of empty shell cases.</p>

<p>Between our infantry lines and those of the German,
there was yet to grow the complete web of woven wire
entanglements that marred the landscapes on the long established
fronts. Still standing, silent sentinels over some
of our front line positions were trees, church steeples,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
dwellings and barns that as yet had not been levelled to
the ground. Dugouts had begun to show their entrances
in the surface of the ground and cross roads had started
to sprout with rudely constructed shelters. Fat sandbags
were just taking the places of potted geraniums on
the sills of first floor windows. War's toll was being exacted
daily, but the country had yet to pay the full price.
It was going through that process of degeneration toward
the stripped and barren but it still held much of its erstwhile
beauty.</p>

<p>Those days before Cantigny were marked by particularly
heavy artillery fire. The ordnance duel was unrelenting
and the daily exchange of shells reached an aggregate
far in excess of anything that the First Division
had ever experienced before.</p>

<p>Nightly the back areas of the front were shattered
with shells. The German was much interested in preventing
us from bringing up supplies and munition.
We manifested the same interest toward him. American
batteries firing at long range, harassed the road intersections
behind the enemy's line and wooded places
where relief troops might have been assembled under
cover of darkness. The expenditure of shells was enormous
but it continued practically twenty-four hours a
day. German prisoners, shaking from the nervous effects
of the pounding, certified to the untiring efforts of
our gunners.</p>

<p>The small nameless village that we occupied almost
opposite the German position in Cantigny seemed to receive
particular attention from the enemy artillery. In
retaliation, our guns almost levelled Cantigny and a
nearby village which the enemy occupied. Every hour,
under the rain of death, the work of digging was continued
and the men doing it needed no urging from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
officers. There was something sinister and emphatic
about the whine of a "two ten German H. E." that inspired
one with a desire to start for the antipodes by the
shortest and most direct route.</p>

<p>The number of arrivals by way of the air in that particular
village every day numbered high in the thousands.
Under such conditions, no life-loving human could have
failed to produce the last degree of utility out of a spade.
The continual dropping of shells in the ruins and the
unending fountains of chalk dust and dirt left little for
the imagination, but one officer told me that it reminded
him of living in a room where some one was eternally
beating the carpet.</p>

<p>This taste of the war of semi-movement was appreciated
by the American soldier. It had in it a dash of novelty,
lacking in the position warfare to which he had
become accustomed in the mud and marsh of the Moselle
and the Meuse. For one thing, there were better and
cleaner billets than had ever been encountered before
by our men. Fresh, unthrashed oats and fragrant hay
had been found in the hurriedly abandoned lofts back
of the line and in the caves and cellars nearer the front.</p>

<p>In many places the men were sleeping on feather mattresses
in old-fashioned wooden bedsteads that had been
removed from jeopardy above ground to comparative
safety below. Whole caves were furnished, and not badly
furnished, by this salvage of furniture, much of which
would have brought fancy prices in any collection of
antiques.</p>

<p>Forced to a recognition solely of intrinsic values, our
men made prompt utilisation of much of the material
abandoned by the civilian population. Home in the field is
where a soldier sleeps and after all, why not have it as
comfortable as his surroundings will afford? Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
caves and vegetable cellars, many with walls and vaulted
ceilings of clean red brick or white blocks of chalk, constituted
excellent shelters from shell splinters and even
protected the men from direct hits by missiles of small
calibre.</p>

<p>Beyond the villages, our riflemen found protection in
quickly scraped holes in the ground. There were some
trenches but they were not contiguous. "No Man's
Land" was an area of uncertain boundary. Our gunners
had quarters burrowed into the chalk not far from their
gun pits. All communication and the bringing up of
shells and food were conducted under cover of darkness.
Under such conditions, we lived and waited for the order
to go forward.</p>

<p>Our sector in that battle of the Somme was so situated
that the opposing lines ran north and south. The
enemy was between us and the rising sun. Behind our
rear echelons was the main road between Amiens and
Beauvais. Amiens, the objective of the German drive,
was thirty-five kilometres away on our left, Beauvais
was the same distance on our right and two hours by
train from Paris.</p>

<p>We were eager for the fight. The graves of our dead
dotted new fields in France. We were holding with the
French on the Picardy line. We were between the Germans
and the sea. We were before Cantigny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE RUSH OF THE RAIDERS&mdash;"ZERO AT 2 A. M."</h3>


<p>While the First U. S. Division was executing in
Picardy a small, planned operation which resulted in the
capture of the German fortified positions in the town of
Cantigny, other American divisions at other parts along
the line were indulging in that most common of frontal
diversions&mdash;the raid.</p>

<p>I was a party to one of these affairs on the Toul front.
The 26th Division, composed of National Guard troops
from New England, made the raid. On Memorial Day,
I had seen those men of the Yankee Division decorating
the graves of their dead in a little cemetery back of the
line. By the dawning light of the next morning, I saw
them come trooping back across No Man's Land after
successfully decorating the enemy positions with German
graves.</p>

<p>It was evening when we dismissed our motor in the
ruined village of Hamondville and came into first contact
with the American soldiers that had been selected for the
raid. Their engineers were at work in the street connecting
sections of long dynamite-loaded pipes which were
to be used to blast an ingress through the enemy's wire.
In interested circles about them were men who were to
make the dash through the break even before the smoke
cleared and the débris ceased falling. They were to be
distinguished from the village garrison by the fact that
the helmets worn by the raiders were covered with burlap
and some of them had their faces blackened.</p>

<p>In the failing evening light, we walked on through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
several heaps of stone and rafters that had once been villages,
and were stopped by a military policeman who inquired
in broad Irish brogue for our passes. These meeting
with his satisfaction, he advised us to avoid the road
ahead with its dangerous twist, known as "Dead Man's
Curve," for the reason that the enemy was at that minute
placing his evening contribution of shells in that vicinity.
Acting on the policeman's suggestion, we took a
short cut across fields rich with shell holes. Old craters
were grown over with the grass and mustard flowers with
which this country abounds at this time of year. Newer
punctures showed as wounds in the yellow soil and contained
pools of evil-smelling water, green with scum.</p>

<p>Under the protection of a ridge, which at least screened
us from direct enemy observation, we advanced toward
the jagged skyline of a ruined village on the crest. The
odour of open graves befouled the sheltered slope, indicating
that enemy shells had penetrated its small protection
and disturbed the final dugouts of the fallen.</p>

<p>Once in the village of Beaumont, we followed the
winding duckboards and were led by small signs painted
on wood to the colonel's headquarters. We descended the
stone steps beneath a rickety looking ruin and entered.</p>

<p>"Guests for our party," was the Colonel's greeting.
The command post had a long narrow interior which was
well lighted but poorly ventilated, the walls and floor were
of wood and a low beamed ceiling was supported by
timbers. "Well, I think it will be a good show."</p>

<p>"We are sending over a little party of new boys just
for practice and a 'look-see' in Hunland. We have two
companies in this regiment which feel they've sorter been
left out on most of the fun to date, so this affair has
been arranged for them. We put the plans together last
week and pushed the boys through three days of training<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
for it back of the lines. They're fit as fiddlers to-night
and it looks like there'll be no interruption to their
pleasure.</p>

<p>"No one man in the world, be he correspondent or
soldier, could see every angle of even so small a thing
as a little raid like this," the Colonel explained. "What
you can't see you have got to imagine. I'm suggesting
that you stay right in here for the show. That telephone
on my adjutant's desk is the web centre of all
things occurring in this sector to-night and the closer
you are to it, the more you can see and learn. Lieutenant
Warren will take you up the road first and give you a
look out of the observatory, so you'll know in what part
of Germany our tourists are going to explore."</p>

<p>Darkness had fallen when we emerged, but there were
sufficient stars out to show up the outline of the gaping
walls on either side of our way. We passed a number of
sentries and entered a black hole in the wall of a ruin.
After stumbling over the uneven floor in a darkened passage
for some minutes, we entered a small room where
several officers were gathered around a table on which
two burning candles were stuck in bottles. Our guide,
stepping to one end of the room, pulled aside a blanket
curtain and passed through a narrow doorway. We followed.</p>

<p>Up a narrow, steep, wooden stairway between two
walls of solid masonry, not over two feet apart, we
passed, and arrived on a none too stable wooded runway
with a guide rail on either side. Looking up through
the ragged remains of the wooden roof frame, now almost
nude of tiles, we could see the starry sky. Proceeding
along the runway, we arrived, somewhere in that
cluster of ruins, in a darkened chamber whose interior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
blackness was relieved by a lighter slit, an opening facing
the enemy.</p>

<p>Against the starry skyline, we could see the black outline
of a flat tableland in the left distance which we knew
to be that part of the heights of Meuse for whose commanding
ridge there have been so many violent contests
between the close-locked lines in the forest of
Apremont. More to the centre of the picture, stood
Mont Sec, detached from the range and pushing its summit
up through the lowland mist like the dorsal fin of
a porpoise in a calm sea. On the right the lowland extended
to indistinct distances, where it blended with the
horizon.</p>

<p>In all that expanse of quiet night, there was not a
single flicker of light, and at that time not a sound to
indicate that unmentionable numbers of our men were
facing one another in parallel ditches across the silent
moor.</p>

<p>"See that clump of trees way out there?" said the
lieutenant, directing our vision with his arm. "Now
then, hold your hand at arm's length in front of you,
straight along a line from your eyes along the left edge
of your hand to that clump of trees. Now then, look
right along the right edge of your hand and you will be
looking at Richecourt. The Boche hold it. We go in on
the right of that to-night."</p>

<p>We looked as per instructions and saw nothing. As
far as we were concerned Richecourt was a daylight
view, but these owls of the lookout knew its location as
well as they knew the streets of their native towns back
in New England. We returned to the colonel's command
post, where cots were provided, and we turned in for a
few hours' sleep on the promise of being called in time.</p>

<p>It was 2 A. M. when we were summoned to command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
post for the colonel's explanation of the night's
plans. The regimental commander, smoking a long pipe
with a curved stem, sat in front of a map on which he
conducted the exposition.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, placing his finger on a section of
the line marking the American trenches, "is the point of
departure. That's the jumping off place. These X
marks running between the lines is the enemy wire, and
here, and here, and here are where we blow it up. We
reach the German trenches at these points and clean up.
Then the men follow the enemy communicating trenches,
penetrate three hundred metres to the east edge of Richecourt,
and return.</p>

<p>"Zero hour is 2:30. It's now 2:10. Our raiders have
left their trenches already. They are out in No Man's
Land now. The engineers are with them carrying explosives
for the wire. There are stretcher bearers in the
party to bring back our wounded and also signal men right
behind them with wire and one telephone. The reports
from that wire are relayed here and we will also be kept
informed by runners. The whole party has thirty minutes
in which to crawl forward and place explosives under
the wire. They will have things in readiness by
2:30 and then the show begins."</p>

<p>Five minutes before the hour, I stepped out of the
dugout and looked at the silent sky toward the front.
Not even a star shell disturbed the blue black starlight.
The guns were quiet. Five minutes more and all this
was to change into an inferno of sound and light, flash
and crash. There is always that minute of uncertainty
before the raiding hour when the tensity of the situation
becomes almost painful. Has the enemy happened to
become aware of the plans? Have our men been deprived
of the needed element of surprise? But for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
thousands of metres behind us, we know that in black
battery pits anxious crews are standing beside their
loaded pieces waiting to greet the tick of 2:30 with the
jerk of the lanyard.</p>

<p>Suddenly the earth trembles. Through the dugout
window facing back from the lines, I see the night sky
burst livid with light. A second later and the crash
reaches our ears. It is deafening. Now we hear the
whine of shells as they burn the air overhead. The telephone
bell rings.</p>

<p>"Yes, this is Boston," the Adjutant speaks into the receiver.
We listen breathlessly. Has something gone
wrong at the last minute?</p>

<p>"Right, I have it," said the Adjutant, hanging up the
receiver and turning to the Colonel; "X-4 reports barrage
dropped on schedule."</p>

<p>"Good," said the Colonel. "Gentlemen, here's what's
happening. Our shells are this minute falling all along
the German front line, in front of the part selected for
the raid and on both flanks. Now then, this section
of the enemy's position is confined in a box barrage which
is pounding in his front and is placing a curtain of fire
on his left and his right and another in his rear. Any
German within the confines of that box trying to get out
will have a damn hard time and so will any who try to
come through it to help him."</p>

<p>"Boston talking," the Adjutant is making answer over
the telephone. He repeats the message. "233, all the
wire blown up, right."</p>

<p>"Fine," says the Colonel. "Now they are advancing
and right in front of them is another rolling barrage of
shells which is creeping forward on the German lines at
the same pace our men are walking. They are walking
in extended order behind it. At the same time our artillery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
has taken care of the enemy's guns by this time
so that no German barrage will be able to come down on
our raiders. Our guns for the last three minutes have
been dumping gas and high explosives on every battery
position behind the German lines. That's called 'Neutralisation.'"</p>

<p>"Boston talking." The room grows quiet again as the
Adjutant takes the message.</p>

<p>"2:36. Y-1 reports O. K."</p>

<p>"Everything fine and dandy," the Colonel observes,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Boston talking." There is a pause.</p>

<p>"2:39. G-7 reports sending up three red rockets east
of A-19. The operator thinks it's a signal for outposts
to withdraw and also for counter barrage."</p>

<p>"Too late," snaps the Colonel. "There's a reception
committee in Hades waiting for 'em right now."</p>

<p>At 2:40 the dugout door opens and in walks Doc Comfort
from the Red Cross First Aid Station across the
road.</p>

<p>"Certainly is a pretty sight, Colonel. Fritzies' front
door is lit up like a cathedral at high mass."</p>

<p>At 2:41. "A very good beginning," remarks a short,
fat French Major who sits beside the Colonel. He represents
the French army corps.</p>

<p>2:43. "Boston talking,&mdash;Lieutenant Kernan reports
everything quiet in his sector."</p>

<p>2:45. "Boston talking," the Adjutant turns to the
Colonel and repeats, "Pittsburgh wants to know if
there's much coming in here."</p>

<p>"Tell them nothing to amount to anything," replies the
Colonel and the Adjutant repeats the message over the
wire. As he finished, one German shell did land so
close to the dugout that the door blew open. The officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
stepped to the opening and called out into the darkness.</p>

<p>"Gas guard. Smell anything?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir. Think they are only high explosives."</p>

<p>2:47. "Boston talking&mdash;enemy sent up one red, one
green rocket and then three green rockets from B-14,"
the Adjutant repeats.</p>

<p>"Where is that report from?" asks the Colonel.</p>

<p>"The operator at Jamestown, sir," replies the Adjutant.</p>

<p>"Be ready for some gas, gentlemen," says the Colonel.
"I think that's Fritzie's order for the stink. Orderly,
put down gas covers on the doors and windows."</p>

<p>I watched the man unroll the chemically dampened
blankets over the doors and windows.</p>

<p>2:49. "Boston talking&mdash;23 calls for barrage."</p>

<p>The Colonel and Major turn immediately to the wall
map, placing a finger on 23 position.</p>

<p>"Hum," says the Colonel. "Counter attack, hey? Well,
the barrage will take care of them, but get me Watson
on the line."</p>

<p>"Connect me with Nantucket," the Adjutant asks the
operator. "Hello, Watson, just a minute," turning to
Colonel, "here's Watson, sir."</p>

<p>"Hello, Watson," the Colonel says, taking the receiver.
"This is Yellow Jacket. Watch out for counter
attack against 23. Place your men in readiness and be
prepared to support Michel on your right. That's all,"
returning 'phone to the Adjutant, "Get me Mr. Lake."</p>

<p>While the Adjutant made the connection, the Colonel
explained quickly the planned flanking movement on the
map. "If they come over there," he said to the French
Major, "not a God-damn one of them will ever get back
alive."</p>

<p>The French Major made a note in his report book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello, Lake," the Colonel says, taking the 'phone.
"This is Yellow Jacket. Keep your runners in close
touch with Michel and Watson. Call me if anything
happens. That's all."</p>

<p>3:00. "Boston talking&mdash;G-2 reports all O.K. Still
waiting for the message from Worth."</p>

<p>3:02. "Storming party reports unhindered progress.
No enemy encountered yet."</p>

<p>This was the first message back from the raiders. It
had been sent over the wire and the instruments they
carried with them and then relayed to the Colonel's command
post.</p>

<p>"<i>Magnifique</i>," says the French Major.</p>

<p>3:04. "Boston talking. X-10 reports gas in Bois des
Seicheprey."</p>

<p>3:05. "Boston talking. Hello, yes, nothing coming
in here to amount to anything. Just had a gas warning
but none arrived yet."</p>

<p>3:07. "Boston talking,&mdash;&mdash;Yes, all right" (turning
to Colonel), "operator just received message from storming
party 'so far so good.'"</p>

<p>"Not so bad for thirty-seven minutes after opening
of the operation," remarks the Colonel.</p>

<p>"What is 'so far so good'?" inquires the French
Major, whose knowledge of English did not extend to
idioms. Some one explained.</p>

<p>3:09. "Boston talking&mdash;Watson reports all quiet
around 23 now."</p>

<p>"Guess that barrage changed their minds," remarks
the Colonel.</p>

<p>With gas mask at alert, I walked out for a breath of
fresh air. The atmosphere in a crowded dugout is stifling.
From guns still roaring in the rear and from in
front came the trampling sound of shells arriving on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
German positions. The first hints of dawn were in the
sky. I returned in time to note the hour and hear:</p>

<p>3:18. "Boston talking&mdash;O-P reports enemy dropping
line of shells from B-4 to B-8."</p>

<p>"Trying to get the boys coming back, hey?" remarks
the Colonel. "A fat chance. They're not coming back
that way."</p>

<p>3:21. "Boston talking&mdash;23 reports that the barrage
called for in their sector was because the enemy had advanced
within two hundred yards of his first position.
Evidently they wanted to start something, but the barrage
nipped them and they fell back fast."</p>

<p>"Perfect," says the French Major.</p>

<p>3:25. "Boston talking&mdash;two green and two red rockets
were sent up by the enemy from behind Richecourt."</p>

<p>"Hell with 'em, now," the Colonel remarks.</p>

<p>3:28. "Boston talking&mdash;all O. K. in Z-2. Still waiting
to hear from Michel."</p>

<p>"I rather wish they had developed their counter attack,"
says the Colonel. "I have a reserve that would
certainly give them an awful wallop."</p>

<p>3:30. "Boston talking&mdash;more gas in Bois des Seicheprey."</p>

<p>3:33. "Boston talking&mdash;white stars reported from
Richecourt."</p>

<p>"They must be on their way back by this time," says
the Colonel, looking at his watch.</p>

<p>3:37. "Boston talking,&mdash;enemy now shelling on the
north edge of the town. A little gas."</p>

<p>3:40. "Boston talking&mdash;X-1 reports some enemy long
range retaliation on our right.</p>

<p>"They'd better come back the other way," says the
Colonel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"That was the intention, sir," the lieutenant reported
from across the room.</p>

<p>3:42. "Boston talking&mdash;signalman with the party reports
everything O. K."</p>

<p>"We don't know yet whether they have had any losses
or got any prisoners," the Colonel remarks. "But the
mechanism seems to have functioned just as well as it
did in the last raid. We didn't get a prisoner that time,
but I sorter feel that the boys will bring back a couple
with them to-night."</p>

<p>3:49. "Boston talking&mdash;G-9 reports some of the raiding
party has returned and passed that point."</p>

<p>"Came back pretty quick, don't you think so, Major?"
said the Colonel with some pride. "Must have returned
over the top."</p>

<p>It is 3:55 when we hear fast footsteps on the stone
stairs leading down to the dugout entrance. There is a
sharp rap on the door followed by the Colonel's command,
"Come in."</p>

<p>A medium height private of stocky build, with shoulders
heaving from laboured breathing and face wet with
sweat, enters. He removes his helmet, revealing disordered
blonde hair. He faces the Colonel and salutes.</p>

<p>"Sir, Sergeant Ransom reports with message from
Liaison officer. All groups reached the objectives. No
enemy encountered on the right, but a party on the left is
believed to be returning with prisoners. We blew up
their dugouts and left their front line in flames."</p>

<p>"Good work, boy," says the Colonel, rising and shaking
the runner's hand. "You got here damn quick. Did
you come by the Lincoln trench?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I came over the top from the battalion post.
Would have been here quicker, but two of us had to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
back one boy to that point before I could get relieved."</p>

<p>"Wounded?"</p>

<p>"No, sir,&mdash;dead."</p>

<p>"Who was it?" asks the young lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Private Kater, sir, my squad mate."</p>

<p>As the sergeant raised his hand in parting salute, all
of us saw suspended from his right wrist a most formidable
weapon, apparently of his own construction. It was
a pick handle with a heavy iron knob on one end and
the same end cushioned with a mass of barbed wire rolled
up like a ball of yarn. He smiled as he noticed our gaze.</p>

<p>"It's the persuader, sir," he said. "We all carried
them."</p>

<p>He had hardly quitted the door when another heavily
breathing figure with shirt half torn off by barbed wire
appeared.</p>

<p>"K Company got there, sir; beg pardon, sir. I mean
sir, Sergeant Wiltur reports, sir, with message from Liaison
officer. All groups reached the objectives. They left
their dugouts blazing and brought back one machine gun
and three prisoners."</p>

<p>"Very good, Sergeant," said the Colonel. "Orderly,
get some coffee for these runners."</p>

<p>"I'd like to see the doctor first, sir," said the runner
with the torn shirt. "Got my hand and arm cut in the
wire."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Colonel, turning to the rest of
the party, "I knew my boys would bring back bacon."</p>

<p>More footsteps on the entrance stairway and two men
entered carrying something between them. Sweat had
streaked through the charcoal coating on their faces leaving
striped zebra-like countenances.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Burlon's compliments, sir," said the first
man. "Here's one of their machine guns."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who got it?" inquired the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Me and him, sir."</p>

<p>"How did you get it?"</p>

<p>"We just rolled 'em off it and took it."</p>

<p>"Rolled who off of it?"</p>

<p>"Two Germans, sir."</p>

<p>"What were they doing all that time?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, they weren't doing anything. They were
dead."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, then," said the Colonel. "How did
you happen to find the machine gun?"</p>

<p>"We knew where it was before we went over, sir," said
the man simply. "We were assigned to get it and bring
it back. We expected we'd have to fight for it, but I
guess our barrage laid out the crew. Anyhow we rushed
to the position and found them dead."</p>

<p>"All right," said the Colonel, "return to your platoon.
Leave the gun here. It will be returned to you later and
will be your property."</p>

<p>I went out with the machine gun captors and walked
with them to the road. There was the hum of motors
high overhead and we knew that American planes were
above, going forward to observe and photograph German
positions before the effects of our bombardments
could be repaired. A line of flame and smoke pouring up
from the enemy's front line showed where their dugouts
and shelters were still burning.</p>

<p>Daylight was pouring down on a ruined village street,
up which marched the returning raiders without thought
of order. They were a happy, gleeful party, with helmets
tipped back from their young faces wet and dirty,
with rifles swung over their shoulders and the persuaders
dangling from their wrists. Most of them were up to
their knees and their wrap puttees were mostly in tatters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
from the contact with the entanglements through
which they had penetrated.</p>

<p>As they approached, I saw the cause for some of the
jocularity. It was a chubby, little, boyish figure, who
sat perched up on the right shoulder of a tall, husky Irish
sergeant. The figure steadied itself by grasping the
sergeant's helmet with his left hand. The sergeant
steadied him by holding one right arm around his legs.</p>

<p>But there was no smile on the face of the thus transformed
object. His chubby countenance was one of
easily understood concern. He was not a day over sixteen
years and this was quite some experience for him.
He was one of the German prisoners and these happy
youngsters from across the seas were bringing him in
almost with as much importance as though he had been
a football hero. He was unhurt and it was unnecessary
to carry him, but this tribute was voluntarily added, not
only as an indication of extreme interest, but to reassure
the juvenile captive of the kindly intentions of his captors.</p>

<p>"Jiggers, here's the Colonel's dugout," one voice
shouted. "Put him down to walk, now."</p>

<p>The big sergeant acted on the suggestion and the little
Fritz was lowered to the ground. He immediately
caught step with the big sergeant and took up the latter's
long stride with his short legs and feet encased in
clumsy German boots. His soiled uniform had been the
German field grey green. His helmet was gone but he
wore well back on his head the flat round cloth cap.
With his fat cheeks he looked like a typical baker's boy,
and one almost expected to see him carrying a tray of
rolls on his head.</p>

<p>"For the luva Mike, Tim," shouted an ambulance man,
"do you call that a prisoner?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure he does look like a half portion," replied
Sergeant Tim with a smile. "We got two hundred
francs for a whole one. I don't know what we can cash
this one in for."</p>

<p>"He ought to be worth more," some one said; "that
barrage cost a million dollars. He's the million dollar
baby of the raid."</p>

<p>"Sergeant, I'm not kidding," came one serious voice.
"Why turn him in as a prisoner? I like the kid's looks.
Why can't we keep him for the company mascot?"</p>

<p>The discussion ended when the Sergeant and his small
charge disappeared in the Colonel's quarters for the inevitable
questioning that all prisoners must go through.
Several wounded were lying on the stretchers in front of
the first aid dugout waiting for returning ambulances
and passing the time meanwhile by smoking cigarettes
and explaining how close each of them had been to the
shell that exploded and "got 'em."</p>

<p>But little of the talk was devoted to themselves. They
were all praise for the little chaplain from New England
who, without arms, went over the top with "his
boys" and came back with them. It was their opinion
that their regiment had some sky pilot. And it was
mine, also.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>ON LEAVE IN PARIS</h3>


<p>"So this&mdash;is Paris,"&mdash;this observation spoken in mock
seriousness, in a George Cohan nasal drawl and accompanied
by a stiff and stagy wave of the arm, was the customary
facetious pass-word with which American soldiers
on leave or on mission announced their presence
in the capital of France.</p>

<p>Paris, the beautiful&mdash;Paris, the gay&mdash;Paris, the historical&mdash;Paris,
the artistic&mdash;Paris, the only Paris, opened
her arms to the American soldier and proceeded toward
his enlightenment and entertainment on the sole policy
that nothing was too good for him.</p>

<p>I saw the first American soldiers under arms reach
Paris. It was early in the morning of July 3rd, 1917,
when this first American troop train pulled into the Gare
d'Austerlitz. It was early in the morning, yet Paris was
there to give them a welcome. The streets outside the
station were jammed with crowds. They had seen
Pershing; they had seen our staff officers and headquarters details,
but now they wanted to see the type of our actual
fighting men&mdash;they wanted to see the American poilus&mdash;the
men who were to carry the Stars and Stripes over
the top.</p>

<p>The men left the cars and lined up in the station yard.
It had been a long, fifteen hour night ride and the
cramped quarters of the troop train had permitted but
little sleep. There was no opportunity for them to breakfast
or wash before they were put on exhibition.
Naturally, they were somewhat nervous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>The standing line was ordered to produce its mess cups
and hold them forward. Down the line came a bevy of
pretty French girls, wearing the uniform of Red Cross
nurses. They carried canisters of black coffee and baskets
of cigarettes. They ladled out steaming cupfuls of the
black liquid to the men. The incident gave our men their
first surprise.</p>

<p>Rum or alcohol has never been a part of the United
States army ration. In the memory of the oldest old-timers
in the ranks of our old regular army, "joy
water" had never been issued. On the other hand, its
use had always been strictly forbidden in the company
messes. Our men never expected it. Thus it was that,
with no other idea occurring to them, they extended their
mess cups to be filled with what they thought was simply
strong hot coffee. Not one of them had the slightest
suspicion that the French cooks who had prepared that
coffee for their new American brothers in arms, had put
a stick in it&mdash;had added just that portion of cognac
which they had considered necessary to open a man's
eyes and make him pick up his heels after a long night
in a troop train.</p>

<p>I watched one old-timer in the ranks as he lifted the
tin cup to his lips and took the initial gulp. Then he
lowered the cup. Across his face there dawned first an
expression of curious suspicion, then a look of satisfied
recognition, and then a smile of pleased surprise, which
he followed with an audible smacking of the lips. He
finished the cup and allowed quite casually that he could
stand another.</p>

<p>"So this is Paris,"&mdash;well, it wasn't half bad to start
with. With that "coffee" under their belts, the men responded
snappily to the march order, and in column of
four, they swung into line and moved out of the station<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
yard, at the heels of their own band, which played a
stirring marching air.</p>

<p>Paris claimed them for her own. All that the war had
left of Paris' gay life, all the lights that still burned, all
the music that still played, all the pretty smiles that had
never been reduced in their quality or quantity, all that
Paris had to make one care-free and glad to be alive&mdash;all
belonged that day to that pioneer band of American
infantrymen.</p>

<p>The women kissed them on the street. Grey-headed
men removed their hats to them and shook their hands
and street boys followed in groups at their heels making
the air ring with shrill "Vive's." There were not
many of them, only three companies. The men looked
trim and clean-cut. They were tall and husky-looking
and the snap with which they walked was good to the
eyes of old Paris that loves verve.</p>

<p>With a thirty-two-inch stride that made their following
admirers stretch their legs, the boys in khaki marched
from the Austerlitz station to the Neuilly barracks over
a mile away, where they went into quarters. Paris was
in gala attire. In preparation for the celebration of the
following day, the shop windows and building fronts
were decked with American flags.</p>

<p>Along the line of march, traffic piled up at the street
intersections and the gendarmes were unable to prevent
the crowds from overflowing the sidewalks and pressing
out into the streets where they could smile their greetings
and throw flowers at closer range. A sergeant flanking
a column stopped involuntarily when a woman on the
curb reached out, grabbed his free hand, and kissed it. A
snicker ran through the platoon as the sergeant, with face
red beneath the tan, withdrew his hand and recaught his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
step. He gave the snickering squads a stern, "Eyes
front!" and tried to look at ease.</p>

<p>How the bands played that day! How the crowds
cheered! How the flags and handkerchiefs and hats
waved in the air, and how thousands of throats volleyed
the "Vive's!" This was the reception of our first fighting
men. But on the following day they received even a
greater demonstration, when they marched through the
streets of the city on parade, and participated in the first
Parisian celebration of American Independence Day.</p>

<p>Parisians said that never before had Paris shown so
many flags, not even during the days three years before,
when the sons of France had marched away to keep the
Germans out of Paris. It seemed that the customary
clusters of Allied flags had been almost entirely replaced
for the day by groups composed solely of the
French tri-colour and the Stars and Stripes. Taxis and
fiacres flew flags and bunting from all attachable places.
Flag venders did wholesale business on the crowded
streets. Street singers sang patriotic parodies, eulogising
Uncle Sam and his nephews, and garnered harvests
of sous for their efforts.</p>

<p>The three companies of our regulars marched with a
regiment of French colonials, all veterans of the war
and many of them incapacitated for front service through
wounds and age. French soldiers on leave from the
trenches and still bearing the mud stains of the battle
front life, cheered from the sidewalks. Bevies of middinettes
waved their aprons from the windows of millinery
shops. Some of them shouted, "Vive les Teddies!"
America&mdash;the great, good America&mdash;the sister republic
from across the seas was spoken of and shouted all day
long. Paris capitulated unconditionally to three companies
of American infantry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>From that day on, every American soldier visiting
Paris has been made to feel himself at home. And the
unrestricted hospitality did not seem to be the result of
an initial wave of enthusiasm. It was continuous. For
months afterward, any one wearing an American uniform
along the boulevards could hear behind him dulcet
whispers that carried the words <i>très gentil</i>.</p>

<p>At first, our enlisted men on leave in Paris or detailed
for work in the city, were quartered in the old Pipincerie
Barracks, where other soldiers from all of the Allied
armies in the world were quartered. Our men mingled
with British Tommies, swarthy Italians and Portuguese,
tall blond Russians, French poilus, Canadians, Australians
and New Zealanders. At considerable expense to these
comrades in arms, our men instructed them in the all-American
art of plain and fancy dice rolling.</p>

<p>Later when our numbers in Paris increased, other arrangements
for housing were made. The American
policing of Paris, under the direction of the Expeditionary
Provost General, Brigadier General Hillaire, was
turned over to the Marines. Whether it was that our
men conducted themselves in Paris with the orderliness
of a guest at the home of his host, or whether it was
that the Marines with their remarkable discipline suppressed
from all view any too hearty outbursts of American
exuberance, it must be said that the appearance and
the bearing of American soldiers in Paris were always
above reproach.</p>

<p>I have never heard of one being seen intoxicated in
Paris, in spite of the fact that more opportunities presented
themselves for drinking than had ever before been
presented to an American army. The privilege of sitting
at a table in front of a sidewalk café on a busy boulevard
and drinking a small glass of beer unmolested, was one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
that our men did not take advantage of. It was against
the law to serve any of the stronger liqueurs to men in
uniform, but beer and light wines were obtainable all the
time. All cafés closed at 9:30. In spite of the ever present
opportunity to obtain beverages of the above character,
there was many and many an American soldier who
tramped the boulevards and canvassed the cafés, drug
stores and delicatessen shops in search of a much-desired
inexistent, ice cream soda.</p>

<p>Many of our men spent their days most seriously and
most studiously, learning the mysteries of transportation
on the busses and the Paris underground system, while
they pored over their guide books and digested pages of
information concerning the points of interest that Paris
had to offer. Holidays found them shuffling through the
tiled corridors of the Invalides or looking down into the
deep crypt at the granite tomb of the great Napoleon. In
the galleries of the Louvre, the gardens of the Tuilleries,
or at the Luxembourg, the American uniform was ever
present. At least one day out of every ten day leave was
spent in the palace and the grounds at Versailles.</p>

<p>The theatres of Paris offered a continual change of
amusement. One of the most popular among these was
the Folies Bergères. Some of our men didn't realise until
after they entered the place that it was a French theatre.
Due to the French pronunciation of the name, some of
the American soldiers got the idea that it was a saloon
run by an Irishman by the name of Foley. "Bergère" to
some was unpronounceable, so the Folies Bergères was
most popularly known in our ranks as "Foley's place."</p>

<p>Another popular amusement place was the Casino de
Paris, where an echo from America was supplied by an
American negro jazz band, which dispensed its questionable
music in the <i>promenoir</i> during the intermission.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
There were five negroes in the orchestra and each one
of them seemed to have an ardent dislike for the remaining
four. Individually they manifested their mutual contempt
by turning their backs on one another while they
played. Strange as it may seem, a most fascinating type
of harmony resulted, producing much swaying of shoulders,
nodding of heads and snapping of fingers among
the American soldiers in the crowd. French men and
women, with their old world musical taste, would consider
the musical gymnastics of the demented drummer
in the orchestra, then survey the swaying Americans and
come to the conclusion that the world had gone plumb
to hell.</p>

<p>All types of American soldiers made Paris their mecca
as soon as the desired permissions had been granted. One
day I sat opposite a remarkable type whom I found dining
in a small restaurant. I noticed the absence of either
beer or wine with his meal, and he frankly explained
that he had never tasted either in his life. He thanked
me, but refused to accept a cigarette I offered, saying
without aside that he had yet his first one to smoke.
When I heard him tell Madame that he did not care for
coffee, I asked him why, and he told me that his mother
had always told him it was injurious and he had never
tasted it.</p>

<p>I became more interested in this ideal, young American
soldier and questioned him about his life. I found that
he and his father had worked in the copper mines in
Michigan. They were both strong advocates of union
labour and had participated vigorously in the bloody
Michigan strikes.</p>

<p>"Father and I fought that strike clear through," he
said. "Our union demands were just. Here in this war
I am fighting just the same way as we fought against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the mine operators in Michigan. I figure it out that
Germany represents low pay, long hours and miserable
working conditions for the world. I think the Kaiser is
the world's greatest scab. I am over here to help get
him."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>One day in the Chatham Hotel, in Paris, I was dining
with an American Brigadier General, when an American
soldier of the ranks approached the table. At a respectful
distance of five feet, the soldier halted, clicked
his heels and saluted the General. He said, "Sir, the
orderly desires permission to take the General's car to
headquarters and deliver the packages."</p>

<p>"All right, Smith," replied the General, looking at his
watch. "Find out if my other uniform is back yet and
then get back here yourself with the car in half an hour."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," replied the man as he saluted, executed
a snappy right about face and strode out of the
dining-room.</p>

<p>"Strange thing about that chauffeur of mine," said
the General to me. "I had a lot of extra work yesterday
on his account. I had to make out his income tax returns.
He and his dad own almost all the oil in Oklahoma.
When he paid his income tax, Uncle Sam got a
little over a hundred thousand dollars. He went in the
army in the ranks. He is only an enlisted private now,
but he's a good one."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Walking out of the Gare du Nord one day, I saw a man
in an American uniform and a French Gendarme vainly
trying to talk with each other. The Frenchman was
waving his arms and pointing in various directions and
the American appeared to be trying to ask questions.
With the purpose of offering my limited knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
French to straighten out the difficulty, I approached the
pair and asked the American soldier what he wanted. He
told me but I don't know what it was to this day. He
spoke only Polish.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It was not alone amidst the gaiety of Paris that our
soldiers spread the fame of America. In the peaceful
countrysides far behind the flaming fronts, the Yankee
fighting men won their way into the hearts of the French
people. Let me tell you the story of a Christmas celebration
in a little French village in the Vosges.</p>

<p>Before dawn there were sounds of movement in the
murky half-light of the village street. A long line of
soldiers wound their way past flaming stoves of the
mess shacks, where the steaming coffee took the chill out
of the cold morning stomachs.</p>

<p>Later the sun broke bright and clear. It glistened on
the snow-clad furrows of the rolling hills, in which, for
centuries, the village of Saint Thiébault has drowsed
more or less happily beside its ancient canal and in the
shadow of the steeple of the church of the good Saint
Thiébault.</p>

<p>Now a thousand men or more, brown-clad and metal-helmeted,
know the huts and stables of Saint Thiébault
as their billets, and the seventy little boys and girls of the
parish know those same thousand men as their new
big brothers&mdash;<i>les bons Américains</i>.</p>

<p>The real daddies and big brothers and uncles of those
seventy youngsters have been away from Saint Thiébault
for a long time now&mdash;yes, this is the fourth Christmas
that the urgent business in northern France has kept
them from home. They may never return but that is unknown
to the seventy young hopefuls.</p>

</div>

<p>There was great activity in the colonel's quarters during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
the morning, and it is said that a sleuthing seventy
were intent on unveiling the mystery of these unusual
American preparations. They stooped to get a peep
through the windows of the room, and Private Larson,
walking his post in front of the sacred precincts, had to
shoo them away frequently with threatening gestures and
Swedish-American-French commands, such as "Allay
veet&mdash;Allay veet t'ell outer here."</p>

<p>An energetic bawling from the headquarters cook
shack indicated that one juvenile investigator had come
to grief. Howls emanated from little Paul Laurent, who
could be seen stumbling across the road, one blue, cold
hand poking the tears out of his eyes and the other holding
the seat of his breeches.</p>

<p>Tony Moreno, the company cook, stood in front of the
cook shack shaking a soup ladle after the departing Paul
and shouting imprecations in Italian-American.</p>

<p>"Tam leetle fool!" shouted Tony as he returned to the
low camp stove and removed a hot pan, the surface of
whose bubbling contents bore an unmistakable imprint.
"Deese keeds make me seek. I catcha heem wit de finger
in de sugar barrel. I shout at heem. He jumpa back. He
fall over de stove and sita down in de pan of beans. He
spoila de mess. He burn heese pants. Tam good!"</p>

<p>And over there in front of the regimental wagon train
picket line, a gesticulating trio is engaged in a three
cornered Christmas discussion. One is M. Lecompte,
who is the uniformed French interpreter on the Colonel's
staff, and he is talking to "Big" Moriarity, the teamster,
the tallest man in the regiment. The third party to the
triangle is little Pierre Lafite, who clings to M. Lecompte's
hand and looks up in awe at the huge Irish
soldier.</p>

<p>"He wants to borrow one of these," M. Lecompte says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
pointing to the enormous hip boots which Moriarity is
wearing.</p>

<p>"He wants to borrow one of me boots?" repeated the
Irishman. "And for the love of heavin, what would he
be after doin' wid it? Sure and the top of it is higher
than the head of him."</p>

<p>"It is for this purpose," explains the interpreter.
"The French children do not hang up their stockings for
Christmas. Instead they place their wooden shoes on
the hearth and the presents and sweets are put in them.
You see, Pierre desires to receive a lot of things."</p>

<p>"Holy Mother!" replies Moriarity, kicking off one
boot and hopping on one foot toward the stables. "Take
it, you scamp, and I hopes you get it filled wid dimonds
and gold dust. But mind ye, if you get it too near the
fire and burn the rubber I'll eat you like you was a
oyster."</p>

<p>The Irish giant emphasised his threat with a grimace
of red-whiskered ferocity and concluded by loudly smacking
his lips. Then little Pierre was off to his mother's
cottage, dragging the seven league boot after him.</p>

<p>With the afternoon meal, the last of the packages had
been tied with red cords and labelled, and the interior of
the Colonel's quarters looked like an express office in the
rush season. The packages represented the purchases
made with 1,300 francs which the men of the battalion
had contributed for the purpose of having Christmas
come to Saint Thiébault in good style.</p>

<p>M. Lecompte has finished sewing the red and white
covering which is to be worn by "Hindenburg," the most
docile mule in the wagon train, upon whom has fallen the
honour of drawing the present loaded sleigh of the
Christmas saint.</p>

<p>"Red" Powers, the shortest, fattest and squattiest man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
in the battalion, is investing himself with baggy, red
garments, trimmed with white fur and tassels, all made
out of cloth by hands whose familiarity with the needle
has been acquired in bayonet practice. Powers has
donned his white wig and whiskers and his red cap,
tasseled in white. He is receiving his final instructions
from the colonel.</p>

<p>"You may grunt, Powers," the colonel is saying, "but
don't attempt to talk French with that Chicago accent.
We don't want to frighten the children. And remember,
you are not Santa Claus. You are Papa Noel. That's
what the French children call Santa Claus."</p>

<p>It is three o'clock, and the regimental band, assembled
in marching formation in the village street, blares out
"I Wish I Were in the Land of Cotton," and there is
an outpouring of children, women and soldiers from
every door on the street. The colonel and his staff stand
in front of their quarters opposite the band, and a
thousand American soldiers, in holiday disregard for
formation, range along either side of the street.</p>

<p>The large wooden gate of the stable yard, next to the
commandant's quarters, swings open; there is a jingle of
bells, and "Hindenburg," resplendent in his fittings, and
Papa Noel Powers sitting high on the package-heaped
sleigh, move out into the street. Their appearance is
met with a crash of cymbals, the blare of the band's
loudest brass, and the happy cries of the children and the
deeper cheers of the men.</p>

<p>Christmas had come to Saint Thiébault. Up the street
went the procession, the band in the lead playing a lively
jingling piece of music well matched to the keenness of
the air and the willingness of young blood to tingle with
the slightest inspiration.</p>

<p>"Hindenburg," with a huge pair of tin spectacles goggling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
his eyes, tossed his head and made the bells ring all
over his gala caparison. Papa Noel, mounted on the
pyramid of presents, bowed right and left and waved his
hands to the children, to the soldiers, to the old men and
the old women.</p>

<p>As the youngsters followed in the wake of the sleigh,
the soldiers picked them up and carried them on their
shoulders, on "piggy" back, or held them out so they
could shake hands with Papa Noel and hear that dignitary
gurgle his appreciation in wonderful north pole
language.</p>

<p>When Papa Noel found out that he could trust the
flour paste and did not have to hold his whiskers on by
biting them, he gravely announced, "Wee, wee," to all the
bright-eyed, red-cheeked salutations directed his way.</p>

<p>The band halted in front of the ancient church of
Saint Thiébault, where old Father Gabrielle stood in the
big doorway, smiling and rubbing his hands. Upon his
invitation the children entered and were placed in the
first row of chairs, the mothers, grandmothers, grandfathers,
and young women sat in back of them, and further
back sat the regimental officers. The soldiers filled
the rest of the church to the doors.</p>

<p>The brief ceremony ended with a solemn benediction
and then the curtains were drawn back from one of the
arches in front of and to the left of the main altar.</p>

<p>There stood Saint Thiébault's first Christmas tree, or
at least the first one in four years. It was lighted with
candles and was resplendent with decorations that represented
long hours of work with shears and paste on the
part of unaccustomed fingers. Suggestions from a thousand
Christmas minds were on that tree, and the result
showed it. The star of Bethlehem, made of tinsel,
glistened in the candlelight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>Not even the inbred decorum of the church was sufficient
to restrain the involuntary expressions of admiration
of the saint by the seventy youngsters. They oh-ed
and ah-ed and pointed, but they enjoyed it not a whit
more than did the other children in the church, some of
whose ages ran to three score and more.</p>

<p>Papa Noel walked down the centre aisle leading a file
of soldiers, each of whom carried a heaping armful of
packages. Young necks craned and eyes bulged as the
packages were deposited on the tables in front of the
communion rail. M. Lecompte raised his hands for
silence and spoke.</p>

<p>"These Americans," he said, "have come to our
country to march and to fight side by side with your
fathers and your big brothers and your uncles and all
the men folk who have been away from Saint Thiébault
so long. These Americans want to take their places for
you to-day. These Americans in doing these things for
you are thinking of their own little girls and little boys
away back across the ocean who are missing their fathers
and big brothers and uncles to-day, just the same as you
miss yours."</p>

<p>There were wet eyes among the women and some of
the older men in khaki closed their eyes and seemed to
be transporting themselves thousands of miles away to
other scenes and other faces. But the reverie was only
for a minute.</p>

<p>M. Lecompte began calling the names for the distribution
of gifts and the children of Saint Thiébault began
their excited progress toward the tables. Here Papa
Noel delivered the prized packages.</p>

<p>"For Marie Louise Larue," said M. Lecompte, "a
hair ribbon of gold and black with a tortoise bandeau."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>"For Gaston Ponsot, a toy cannon that shoots and six
German soldiers at least to shoot."</p>

<p>"For Colette Daville, a warm cape of red cloth with
a collar of wool."</p>

<p>"For Alphonse Bénois, an aeroplane that flies on a
string."</p>

<p>"For Eugenie Fontaine, a doll that speaks."</p>

<p>"For Emilie Moreau, a pair of shoes with real leather
soles and tops."</p>

<p>"For Camille Laurent, red mittens of wool and a sheepskin
muff."</p>

<p>"For Jean Artois, a warship that moves and flies the
American flag."</p>

<p>It continued for more than an hour. The promoters
of the celebration were wise to their work. There was
more than one present for each child. They did not know
how many. Time after time, their names were called and
they clattered forward in their wooden shoes for each
new surprise.</p>

<p>The presents ran the range of toys, clothing, games,
candies and nuts, but the joy was in sitting there and
waiting for one's name to be called and going forward to
partake of that most desirable "more."</p>

<p>Big Moriarity had his hands in the incident that served
as a climax to the distribution. He had whispered something
to M. Lecompte and the result was that one little
duffer, who sat all alone on a big chair, and hugged an
enormous rubber boot, waited and waited expectantly to
hear the name "Pierre Lafite" called out.</p>

<p>All the other names had been called once and not his.
He waited. All the names had been called twice and still
not his. He waited through the third and the fourth calling
in vain, and his chin was beginning to tremble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
suspiciously as the fifth calling proceeded without the
sound of his name.</p>

<p>The piles of packages on the tables had been getting
smaller all the time. Then M. Lecompte pronounced
the very last name.</p>

<p>"Pierre Lafite," he called.</p>

<p>Pierre's heart bounded as he slipped off the chair and
started up the aisle dragging his big rubber boot. The
rest of the children had returned to their seats. All the
elders in the church were watching his progress.</p>

<p>"For Pierre Lafite," repeated M. Lecompte, holding up
the enormous boot. "A pair of real leather shoes to fit in
the foot of the boot." He placed them there.</p>

<p>"And a pair of stilts to fit in the leg of the boot." He
so placed them.</p>

<p>"And a set of soldiers, twenty-four in number, with a
general commanding, to go beside the stilts." He poured
them into the boot.</p>

<p>"And a pair of gloves and a stocking cap to go on top
of the soldiers.</p>

<p>"And a baseball and a bat to go on top of the gloves.</p>

<p>"And all the chinks to be filled up with nuts and figs,
and sweets. <i>Voilà</i>, Pierre," and with these words, he
had poured the sweetmeats in overflowing measure into
the biggest hip boot in the regiment.</p>

<p>Amid the cheers of the men, led by big Moriarity,
Pierre started toward his seat, struggling with the seven
league boot and the wholesale booty, and satisfied with
the realisation that in one haul he had obtained more
than his companions in five.</p>

<p>Company B quartet sang "Down in a Coal Hole," and
then, as the band struck up outside the church, all moved
to the street. The sun had gone down, the early winter
night had set in, and the sky was almost dark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"Signal for the barrage," came the command in the
darkness.</p>

<p>There were four simultaneous hisses of fire and four
comets of flame sprang up from the ground. They broke
far overhead in lurid green.</p>

<p>"Signal for enemy planes overhead," was the next
command, and four more rockets mounted and ended
their flights in balls of luminous red. Other commands,
other signals, other rockets, other lights and flares and
pistol star shells, enriched a pyrotechnical display which
was economically combined with signal practice.</p>

<p>The red glare illuminated the upturned happy faces of
American and French together. Our men learned to love
the French people. The French people learned to love us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>CHÂTEAU-THIERRY AND THE BOIS DE BELLEAU</h3>


<p>I have endeavoured to show in preceding chapters the
development of the young American army in France
from a mere handful of new troops up to the creation of
units capable of independent action on the front. Only
that intense and thorough training made it possible for
our oversea forces to play the veteran part they did play
in the great Second Battle of the Marne.</p>

<p>The battle developed as a third phase of the enemy's
Western Front offensives of the year. The increasing
strength of the American forces overseas forced Germany
to put forth her utmost efforts in the forlorn hope
of gaining a decision in the field before the Allied lines
could have the advantage of America's weight.</p>

<p>On March 21st, the Germans had launched their first
powerful offensive on a front of fifty miles from Arras
to Noyon in Picardy and had advanced their lines from
St. Quentin to the outskirts of Amiens.</p>

<p>On April 9th, the German hordes struck again in
Flanders on a front of twenty miles from Lens northward
to the River Lys and had cut into the Allied front
as far as Armentières.</p>

<p>There followed what was considered an abnormal delay
in the third act of the demonstration. It was known
that the Germans were engaged in making elaborate arrangements
for this mid-summer push. It was the enemy
hope in this great offensive to strike a final effective blow
against the hard-pressed Allied line before America's rising
power could be thrown into the fight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>The blow fell on the morning of May 27th. The front
selected for the assault was twenty-five miles in width,
extending from the Ailette near Vauxaillon to the Aisne-Marne
Canal near Brimont. The Prussian Crown Prince
was the titular chief of the group of armies used in the
assault. One of these forces was the army of General
von Boehm, which before the attack had numbered only
nine divisions and had extended from the Oise at Noyon
to east of Craconne. The other army was that of General
Fritz von Bülow, previously composed of eight divisions
and supporting a front that extended from
Craconne across the Rheims front to Suippe, near Auberive.
On the day of the attack, these armies had been
strengthened to twice their normal number of divisions,
and subsequently captured German plans revealed that
the enemy expected to use forty-five divisions or practically
half a million men in the onslaught.</p>

<p>The battle began at dawn. It was directed against the
weakly held French positions on the Chemin des Dames.
It was preceded by a three hour bombardment of terrific
intensity. The French defenders were outnumbered
four to one. The Germans put down a rolling barrage
that was two miles deep. It destroyed all wire communications
and flooded battery emplacements and machine
gun posts with every brand of poison gas known to German
kultur. Dust and artificial smoke clouds separated
the defenders into small groups and screened the attacking
waves until they had actually penetrated the French
positions.</p>

<p>The French fought hard to resist the enemy flood
across the Chemin des Dames with its ground sacred with
tragic memories, but a withdrawal was necessary. The
French command was forced to order a retreat to the
Aisne. Hard-fighting French divisions and some units<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
of the British Fifth Army, which had been badly hit in
Picardy in March, made an orderly withdrawal southward.</p>

<p>On the second day of the fight the enemy made a
strong thrust toward Soissons, and after keeping the city
under continual bombardment, succeeded in overcoming
all resistance and occupying the city on May 29th. On
the first day of the attack alone, twelve thousand explosive,
incendiary and poison gas shells were hurled in
amongst the hospitals in Soissons. American ambulance
units did heroic work in the removal of the wounded.</p>

<p>The Germans forced a crossing on the Aisne. On the
following day, May 30th, they had crossed the Vesle
River and had captured Fère-en-Tardenois. On the following
day their victorious hordes had reached the Marne
and were closing in on Château-Thierry.</p>

<p>Some idea of the terrific strength of the enemy offensive
may be gained from a recapitulation which would
show that in five days the Germans had pushed through
five successive lines of Allied defence, and had penetrated
more than twenty-five miles. On the first day,
they had captured the Chemin des Dames, on the second
day, they had overcome all resistance on the Aisne, on
the third day, their forces, pushing southward, had
crossed the Vesle River, on the fourth day, they had
destroyed the lines of resistance along the Ourcq, on the
fifth day, they had reached the Marne.</p>

<p>It was a crisis. The battle front formed a vast triangle
with the apex pointing southward toward Paris. The
west side of the triangle extended fifty miles northward
from the Marne to the Oise near Noyon. The east side
of the triangle ran north-eastward thirty miles to Rheims.
The point of this new thrust at Paris rested on the north
bank of the Marne at Château-Thierry. The enemy had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
advanced to within forty miles of the capital of France;
the fate of the Allied world hung in the balance.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly I am prejudiced, but I like to feel that
I know the real reason why the German hordes stopped
at Château-Thierry on the north bank of the Marne. To
me that reason will always be this&mdash;because on the south
bank of the Marne stood the Americans.</p>

<p>On that day and in that event there materialised the
German fears which had urged them on to such great
speed and violence. In the eleventh hour, there at the
peak of the German thrust, there at the climax of Germany's
triumphant advances, there at the point where a
military decision for the enemy seemed almost within
grasp, there and then the American soldier stepped into
the breech to save the democracy of the world.</p>

<p>The Marne River makes a loop at this place and
Château-Thierry lies on both banks. The Marne there
is called a river, but it would hardly come up to the
American understanding of the word. The waterway
is more like a canal with banks built up with stone blocks.
There are streets on either bank, and these being the
principal streets of the town, are bordered with comparatively
high buildings.</p>

<p>While the Germans were on the outskirts of the city,
American forces had made brilliant counter attacks on
both sides. To the west of Château-Thierry the German
advance forces, seeking to penetrate Neuilly Wood,
had been hurled back by our young troops. To the east
of Château-Thierry the enemy had succeeded in crossing
the Marne in the vicinity of Jaulgonne.</p>

<p>This operation was carried out by the German 36th
Division. On the night of May 30th, at a point where
the Marne looped northward eight miles to the east of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Château-Thierry, the enemy succeeded in putting a few
men across the river.</p>

<p>Along the south bank of the river at that place, the
Paris-Châlons ran through a number of deep cuts and one
tunnel. The enemy took shelter in these natural protections.
They suffered serious losses from the Allied
artillery which also destroyed some of their pontoons
across the river, but in spite of this, the Germans succeeded
in re-enforcing the units on the south bank to
the strength of about a battalion.</p>

<p>Almost at the same time, the French defenders at this
place received re-enforcements from the Americans.
Units of the 3rd United States Regular Division and the
28th U. S. Division, comprised largely of Pennsylvania
National Guardsmen, were rushed forward from training
areas, miles back of the line, where they were engaged in
fitting themselves for line duty. These incompletely
trained American units abandoned their bayonet-stabbing
of gunny-sacks and make-believe warfare to rush forward
into the real thing.</p>

<p>On June 2nd, these Americans, under command of
French officers, began the counter attack to sweep the
Germans back from the south bank. By that time the
enemy had succeeded in putting twenty-two light bridges
across the Marne and had established a strong bridgehead
position with a number of machine guns and a
strong force of men in the railway station on the south
bank of the river opposite Jaulgonne.</p>

<p>This position was attacked frontally by the Americans
and French. Our novices in battle were guilty of numerous
so-called strategical blunders, but in the main
purpose of killing the enemy, they proved irresistible.
The Germans broke and ran. At the same time, the
French artillery lowered a terrific barrage on the bridges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
crossing the river, with the result that many of the fleeing
enemy were killed and more drowned. Only thirty
or forty escaped by swimming. One hundred of them
threw down their arms and surrendered. The remainder
of the battalion was wiped out. At the close of the engagement
the Americans and the French were in full
command of the south bank.</p>

<p>But it was in Château-Thierry itself that the Germans
made their most determined effort to cross the river and
get a footing on the south bank, and it was there, again,
that their efforts were frustrated by our forces. On May
31st, American machine gun units, then in training seventy-five
kilometres south of the Marne, were hurriedly
bundled into motor lorries and rushed northward into
Château-Thierry.</p>

<p>The Germans were advancing their patrols into the
north side of the city. They were pouring down the
streets in large numbers, with the evident purpose of
crossing the bridges and establishing themselves on the
south bank.</p>

<p>It was four o'clock in the afternoon of May 31st that
those American machine gunners got their first glimpse
of real war. That night while the German artillery raked
the south bank of the river with high explosive shells,
those Americans, shouldering their machine guns,
marched into the city and took up defensive positions on
the south bank of the river.</p>

<p>During the night many houses were turned into ruins.
Shells striking the railroad station had caused it to burn.
In the red glare our men saw the houses about them collapse
under clouds of dust and débris. Under cover of
darkness the Germans filtered through the streets on the
north side of the river. The American machine gunners
went into position in the windows of houses on the south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
bank and in gardens between the houses, and from these
positions it was possible to command all of the bridge
approaches and streets leading to the river on the opposite
side.</p>

<p>During the night, Lieutenant John T. Bissell, a young
Pittsburgher but recently graduated from West Point,
started across one of the bridges and reached the north
bank with a squad of a dozen men and two machine guns.
This little unit went into position in a place commanding
the forked highways which converged not far from the
northern approach of the iron bridge crossing the river.
It was this unit's function to prevent the enemy advance
from this direction. The unit was separated from its
comrades on the south bank by the river and about two
hundred yards. In spite of the fact that the enemy artillery
intensified its shelling of the south bank, the American
machine gunners remained at their posts without
firing and played a waiting game.</p>

<p>With the coming of dawn the Germans began to make
their rushes for the bridges. Small compact forces would
dart forward carrying light machine guns and ammunition
with them. They encountered a terrific burst of
American fire and wilted in front of it. Those that survived
crawled back to the shelter of protecting walls,
where they were re-enforced with fresh units, and again
the massed formations charged down the streets toward
the bridges. The slaughter of Germans increased until
the approaches were dotted with bodies of the enemy
slain.</p>

<p>On June 1st, the Germans having consolidated positions
on the hills commanding the city from the north,
they directed a terrific artillery and machine gun fire into
our exposed positions on the south bank, as well as the
small posts still held on the north bank by Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Bissell and his machine gunners. Although the position
held by the little American group had long been considered
untenable, the members of it stuck it out until nightfall,
when they received orders to retire to the south
bank. At the same time, French colonials which had
held a position throughout the day on the north bank on
the edge of the town, withdrew in accordance with the
same plan. The retirement of both parties was covered
by our machine gunners on the south bank, who poured
a hot fire into the evacuated areas as the Germans began
occupying them.</p>

<p>By 10:30 that night the completion of the movement
was signalised by a terrific explosion, as the French
colonials blew up one of the stone bridges over which
they had withdrawn. But the destruction of the bridge
had cut off the little band of Americans and left them
almost surrounded by the enemy on the north bank of
the river, which was now becoming strongly populated
by the enemy. Through the darkness could be heard
the sound of shuffling, hobnailed boots, and even above
the crack of the guns there came the weird swish of
the grey coats as they pushed forward in mass formations.</p>

<p>The little party of thirteen Americans dismantled their
guns and, with each man carrying his allotted piece, they
began working their way along the river bank toward
the main bridge, where they discovered that the enemy
was almost upon them. They immediately went into
position behind the stone parapet on the very brink of
the river, and, although in constant danger from the
American fire that poured out from the south bank, they
poured streams of lead point-blank into the advancing
German ranks.</p>

<p>The Americans on the south bank were not aware of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
the plight of the little party on the north bank. In spite
of their losses, the Germans continued their grewsome
rushes toward the approaches of the iron bridge across
which our machine gunners were pouring a devastating
fire. Lieutenant Bissell and his men made one effort to
cross the bridge, but were forced to crawl back to shelter
on the north bank, carrying with them three of their
wounded. They found themselves between a cross-fire.
Then Bissell, alone, approached as near as he dared, and
the first intimation that the Americans on the south bank
had of the fact that Americans were in front of them
was when Lieutenant Cobey heard Bissell's voice calling
his name. A cease fire order was immediately given and
Bissell and his men rushed across the bridge, carrying
their wounded with them.</p>

<p>On the following day the Germans were in occupation
of all the houses facing the north bank of the river, and
could be seen from time to time darting from one shelter
to another. Throughout the day their artillery maintained
a terrific downpour of shells on the positions held
by our men on the south bank. So intense was the rifle
fire and activity of snipers, that it meant death to appear
in the open. The Americans manned their guns throughout
the day, but refrained from indulging in machine gun
fire because it was not desired to reveal the locations
of the guns. Nightfall approached with a quiet that was
deadly ominous of impending events.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock the enemy formations lunged forward
to the attack. Their dense masses charged down the
streets leading toward the river. They sang as they advanced.
The orders, as revealed in documents captured
later, came straight from the high command and demanded
the acquisition of a foothold on the south bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
at all costs. They paid the costs, but never reached the
south bank.</p>

<p>The American machine gun fire was withering. Time
after time, in the frequent rushes throughout the night,
the remnants of enemy masses would reach sometimes
as far as the centre of the big bridge, but none of them
succeeded in reaching the south bank. The bridge became
carpeted with German dead and wounded. They
lay thick in the open streets near the approaches. By
morning their dead were piled high on the bridge and
subsequent rushes endeavoured to advance over the
bodies of their fallen comrades. In this battle of the
bridges and the streets, our men showed a courage and
determination which aroused the admiration of the
French officers, who were aware by this time that forty-eight
hours before these same American soldiers had seen
battle for the first time.</p>

<p>Our machine gunners turned the northern bank of the
river into a No Man's Land. Their vigilance was unrelenting
and every enemy attempt to elude it met with
disaster. There were serious American casualties during
that terrific fire, but they were nothing in comparison with
the thousand or more German dead that dotted the streets
and clogged the runways of the big bridge in piles. The
last night of the fight enormous charges of explosive were
placed beneath the bridge and discharged.</p>

<p>The bridge was destroyed. High into the air were
blown bits of stone, steel, timber, débris, wreckage and
the bodies of German dead, all to fall back into the river
and go bobbing up and down in the waters of the Marne.</p>

<p>Thus did the Americans save the day at Château-Thierry,
but it became immediately necessary for the
French high command to call upon our young forces for
another great effort. In response to this call, the Second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
United States Division, including one brigade of the
United States Marines, the 5th and 6th Regiments,
started for the front. The division was then occupying
support positions in the vicinity of Gisors behind the
Picardy line. At four o'clock on the morning of May
31st the Marine brigade and regiments of United States
infantry, the 9th and the 23rd Regulars, boarded camions,
twenty to thirty men and their equipment in each vehicle.</p>

<p>They were bound eastward to the valley of the Marne.
The road took them through the string of pretty villages
fifteen miles to the north of Paris. The trucks loaded
with United States troops soon became part of the endless
traffic of war that was pouring northward and eastward
toward the raging front. Our men soon became
coated with the dust of the road. The French people in
the villages through which they passed at top speed
cheered them and threw flowers into the lorries.</p>

<p>Between Meaux and Château-Thierry, where the road
wound along the Marne, our men encountered long
trains of French refugees, weary mothers carrying hungry
babies at the breast, farm wagons loaded with household
belongings, usually surmounted by feather mattresses
on which rode grey-haired grandfathers and
grandmothers. This pitiful procession was moving
toward the rear driving before it flocks of geese and
herds of cattle. On the other side of the road war, grim
war, moved in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The Second Division was bound for the line to the
northwest of Château-Thierry. On June 1st, the 6th
Marines relieved the French on the support lines. The
sector of the 6th Regiment joined on the left the sector
held by two battalions of the 5th. The line on the right
was held by the French. On June 2nd, the hard-pressed
French line, weak and weary from continual rear guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
actions, over a hard fighting period of almost a week,
fell back by prearranged plan and passed through the
support positions which we held. To fill gaps between
units, the Marines extended their brigade sector to between
twelve and fourteen kilometres. As the French
withdrew to the rear, hard pressed by the enemy, the
Marines held the new first line.</p>

<p>The regimental headquarters of the 6th was located
in a stone farmhouse at a cross-roads called La Voie
Châtel, situated between the villages of Champillon and
Lucy-le-Bocage. There was clear observation from that
point toward the north. At five o'clock in the afternoon
on that day of clear visibility, the Germans renewed their
attacks from the north and northeast toward a position
called Hill 165, which was defended by the 5th Regiment.</p>

<p>The Germans advanced in two solid columns across a
field of golden wheat. More than half of the two columns
had left the cover of the trees and were moving
in perfect order across the field when the shrapnel fire
from the American artillery in the rear got range on
the target. Burst after burst of white smoke suddenly
appeared in the air over the column, and under each
burst the ground was marked with a circle of German
dead. It was not barrage fire: it was individual firing
against two individual moving targets and its success
spoke well for the training which that brigade of American
artillery had received.</p>

<p>French aviators from above directed the fire of our
guns, and from high in the air signalled down their
"bravos" in congratulation on the excellent work. At
the same time, the machine gunners of the 5th covered
the ravines and wooded clumps with a hot fire to prevent
small bodies of the enemy from infiltrating through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
our lines. The French marvelled at the deliberateness
and accuracy of our riflemen.</p>

<p>The Germans, unaware that a change had taken
place in the personnel that faced them, reeled back demoralised
and unable to understand how such a sudden
show of resistance had been presented by the weakened
French troops which they had been driving before them
for a week. The enemy's advance had been made openly
and confidently in the mistaken flush of victory. Their
triumphant advances of the previous week had more than
supported the statements of the German officers, who
had told their men that they were on the road to Paris&mdash;the
end of the war and peace. It was in this mood of
victory that the enemy encountered the Marines' stone
wall and reeled back in surprise.</p>

<p>That engagement, in addition to lowering the enemy
morale, deprived them of their offensive spirit and placed
them on the defensive. The next few days were spent
in advancing small strong points and the strengthening of
positions. In broad daylight one group of Marines
rushed a German machine gun pit in the open, killed or
wounded every man in the crew, disabled the gun and
got back to their lines in safety.</p>

<p>It was at five o'clock on the bright afternoon of June
6th that the United States Marines began to carve their
way into history in the battle of the Bois de Belleau.
Major General Harbord, former Chief of Staff to General
Pershing, was in command of the Marine brigade.
Orders were received for a general advance on the brigade
front. The main objectives were the eastern edge of the
Bois de Belleau and the towns of Bussiares, Torcy and
Bouresches.</p>

<p>Owing to the difficulty of liaison in the thickets of the
wood, and because of the almost impossible task of directing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
it in conjunction with the advancing lines, the
artillery preparation for the attack was necessarily brief.
At five o'clock to the dot the Marines moved out from
the woods in perfect order, and started across the wheat
fields in four long waves. It was a beautiful sight, these
men of ours going across those flat fields toward the
tree clusters beyond from which the Germans poured
a murderous machine gun fire.</p>

<p>The woods were impregnated with nests of machine
guns, but our advance proved irresistible. Many of our
men fell, but those that survived pushed on through the
woods, bayoneting right and left and firing as they
charged. So sweeping was the advance that in some
places small isolated units of our men found themselves
with Germans both before and behind them.</p>

<p>The enemy put up a stubborn resistance on the left,
and it was not until later in the evening that this part of
the line reached the northeast edge of the woods, after it
had completely surrounded a most populous machine gun
nest which was located on a rocky hill. During the
fighting Colonel Catlin was wounded and Captain Laspierre,
the French liaison officer, was gassed, two casualties
which represented a distinct blow to the brigade, but
did not hinder its further progress.</p>

<p>On the right Lieutenant Robertson, with twenty survivors
out of his entire platoon, emerged from the terrific
enemy barrage and took the town of Bouresches at
the point of the bayonet. Captain Duncan, receiving
word that one Marine company, with a determination to
engage the enemy in hand-to-hand combat, had gone two
hundred yards in advance, raced forward on the double
quick with the 96th Marine Company, and was met by a
terrific machine gun barrage from both sides of Bouresches.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>Lieutenant Robertson, looking back, saw Duncan and
the rest of his company going down like flies as they
charged through the barrage. He saw Lieutenant Bowling
get up from the ground, his face white with pain,
and go stumbling ahead with a bullet in his shoulder.
Duncan, carrying a stick and with his pipe in his mouth,
was mowed down in the rain of lead. Robertson saw
Dental Surgeon Osborne pick Duncan up. With the
aid of a Hospital Corps man, they had just gained the
shelter of some trees when a shell wiped all three of them
out.</p>

<p>In the street fighting that ensued in Bouresches, Lieutenant
Robertson's orderly, Private Dunlavy, who was
later killed in the defence of the town, captured one of
the enemy's own machine guns and turned it against
them.</p>

<p>In the dense woods the Germans showed their mastery
of machine gun manipulation and the method of infiltration
by which they would place strong units in our
rear and pour in a deadly fire. Many of these guns were
located on rocky ridges, from which they could fire to
all points. These Marines worked with reckless courage
against heavy odds, and the Germans exacted a heavy
toll for every machine gun that was captured or disabled,
but in spite of losses the Marine advance continued.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Overton, commanding the 76th Company,
made a brilliant charge against a strong German position
at the top of a rocky hill. He and his men captured all
of the guns and all of their crews. Overton was hit
later when the Germans retaliated by a concentration of
fire against the captured position for forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Robertson, according to the report brought
back by a regimental runner, was last seen flat on a rock
not twenty yards away from one enemy gun, at which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
he kept shooting with an automatic in each hand. He
was hit three times before he consented to let his men
carry him to the rear.</p>

<p>"There was not an officer left in the 82nd Company,"
according to a letter by Major Frank E. Evans, Adjutant
of the Sixth. "Major Sibley and his Adjutant reorganised
them under close fire and led them in a charge
that put one particular machine gun nest out of business
at the most critical time in all the fighting. I heard later
that at that stage some one said: 'Major Sibley ordered
that&mdash;' and another man said: 'Where in hell is Sibley?'
Sibley was twenty yards away at that time and a hush
went down the line when they saw him step out to lead
the charge.</p>

<p>"And when the word got around through that dead-tired,
crippled outfit that 'the Old Man' was on the line,
all hell could not have stopped that rush."</p>

<p>In such fashion did the Marines go through the Bois
de Belleau. Their losses were heavy, but they did the
work. The sacrifice was necessary. Paris was in danger.
The Marines constituted the thin line between the
enemy and Paris. The Marines not only held that line&mdash;they
pushed it forward.</p>

<p>The fighting was terrific. In one battalion alone the
casualties numbered sixty-four per cent. officers and
sixty-four per cent. men. Several companies came out
of the fighting under command of their first sergeants, all
of the officers having been killed or wounded.</p>

<p>I witnessed some of that fighting. I was with the
Marines at the opening of the battle. I never saw men
charge to their death with finer spirit. I am sorry that
wounds prevented me from witnessing the victorious conclusion
of the engagement. In view of my subsequent
absence from the fight, I wish to give credit and thanks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
at this place to Major Frank E. Evans, who as Adjutant
of the 6th Regiment of Marines, provided me with
much of the foregoing material which occurred while
I was in the hospital.</p>

<p>The bravery of that Marine brigade in the Bois de
Belleau fight will ever remain a bright chapter in the
records of the American Army. For the performance
of deeds of exceptional valour, more than a hundred
Marines were awarded Distinguished Service Crosses.
General Pershing, in recognition of the conduct of the
Second Division, issued the following order:</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p>"It is with inexpressible pride and satisfaction that
your commander recounts your glorious deeds on the field
of battle. In the early days of June on a front of twenty
kilometres, after night marches and with only the reserve
rations which you carried, you stood like a wall
against the enemy advance on Paris. For this timely
action you have received the thanks of the French people
whose homes you saved and the generous praise of your
comrades in arms.</p>

<p>"Since the organisation of our sector, in the face of
strong opposition, you have advanced your lines two
kilometres on a front of eight kilometres. You have
engaged and defeated with great loss three German divisions
and have occupied important strong points&mdash;Belleau
Wood, Bouresches, and Vaux. You have taken
about 1,400 prisoners, many machine guns, and much
other material. The complete success of the infantry
was made possible by the splendid co-operation of the
artillery, by the aid and assistance of the engineer and
signal troops, by the diligent and watchful care of the
medical and supply services, and by the unceasing work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
of the well-organised staff. All elements of the division
have worked together as a well-trained machine.</p>

<p>"Amid the dangers and trials of battle, every officer
and every man has done well his part. Let the stirring
deeds, hardships, and sacrifices of the past month remain
forever a bright spot in our history. Let the sacred
memory of our fallen comrades spur us on to renewed
effort and to the glory of American arms."</p></div>

<p>All of the German prisoners captured by the Marines
in the Bois de Belleau could express only surprise over
the fighting capacity of their captors. Prisoners' statements
are not entirely trustworthy, but here is one that
was not intended for American consumption. It was written
by a German soldier, who was killed in the Bois de
Belleau before he had an opportunity to mail it. It was
removed from his body. It reads:</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p class='quotdate'>
"France, June 21, 1918.<br />
</p>

<p>"We are now in the battle zone and canteens dare not
come to us on account of the enemy, for the Americans
are bombarding the villages fifteen kilometres behind the
present front with long-range guns, and you will know
that the canteen outfit and the others who are lying in
reserve do not venture very far, for it is not 'pleasant to
eat cherries' with the Americans. The reason for that
is that they have not yet had much experience. The
American divisions are still too fiery. They are the first
divisions that the French have entered.... We will also
show the Americans how good we are, for the day before
yesterday we bombarded them heavily with our
gas. About 400 of us are lying around here. We have
one corner of the woods and the American has the other
corner. That is not nice, for all of a sudden he rushes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
forward and one does not know it beforehand. Therefore,
one must shoot at every little noise, for one cannot
trust them. Here always two men have dug a hold for
themselves. Here one lies day and night without a blanket,
only with a coat and a shelter-half. One freezes at
night like a tailor, for the nights are fiercely cold. I hope
that I will be lucky enough to escape from this horrible
mess, for up to now I have always been lucky. Many of
my comrades are already buried here. The enemy sweeps
every evening the whole countryside with machine gun
and rifle fire, and then artillery fire. But we in front line
are safer than in the support position. At present our
food is miserable. We are now fed upon dried vegetables
and marmalade and when at night we obtain more food
it is unpalatable. It is half sour and all cold. In the
daytime we receive nothing."</p></div>

<p>But it might be wise to support this statement from a
German soldier in the ranks by excerpts from an official
German army report which was captured July 7th on a
German officer. The document was a carefully weighed
treatise on the fighting capacity of the United States
Marines. The document had the following heading:</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p><i>"Intelligence Officer of the Supreme Command at Army
Headquarters, Number 7, J. Number 3,528, Army
Headquarters, June 17, 1917.</i></p>

<p><i>"Second American Infantry Division.</i></p>

<p><i>"Examination of Prisoners from the 5th, 6th, 9th and
23rd Regiments, captured from June 5th to 14th, in the
Bouresches Sector."</i></p></div>

<p>After setting forth all information gained, concerning
the purpose of attack and the arrival of the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
units on the line, the German Intelligence Report continues,
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p>"The Second American Division may be classed as a
very good division, perhaps even as assault troops. The
various attacks of both regiments on Belleau Wood were
carried out with dash and recklessness. The moral effect
of our firearms did not materially check the advances
of the enemy. The nerves of the Americans are
still unshaken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">"Value of the individual</span>&mdash;the individual soldiers
are very good. They are healthy, vigorous, and physically
well-developed men, of ages ranging from eighteen
to twenty-eight, who at present lack only necessary training
to make them redoubtable opponents. The troops
are fresh and full of straightforward confidence. A remark
of one of the prisoners is indicative of their spirit:
'We kill or get killed.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">"Morale</span>&mdash;the prisoners in general make an alert and
pleasing impression. Regarding military matters, however,
they do not show the slightest interest. Their superiors
keep them purposely without knowledge of the
military subjects. For example, most of them have never
seen a map. They are no longer able to describe the villages
and roads through which they marched. Their idea
of the organisation of their unit is entirely confused.
For example, one of them told us that his brigade had
six regiments and his division twenty-four. They still
regard the war from the point of view of the 'big
brother' who comes to help his hard-pressed brethren
and is therefore welcomed everywhere. A certain moral
background is not lacking. The majority of the prisoners
simply took as a matter of course that they have come
to Europe to defend their country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only a few of the troops are of pure American origin;
the majority is of German, Dutch and Italian parentage,
but these semi-Americans, almost all of whom
were born in America and never have been in Europe before,
fully feel themselves to be true born sons of their
country.</p>

<p class='quotsig'>
(Signed) "<span class="smcap">Von Berg</span>,<br />
"Lieutenant and Intelligence Officer."<br />
</p></div>

<p>Since the days I read Hugo's chapters on the Battle
of Waterloo in "Les Misérables," I always considered as
an ideal of fighting capacity and the military spirit of
sacrifice the old sergeant of Napoleon's Old Guard.
Hugo made me vividly see that old sergeant standing on
a field with a meagre remnant of the Old Guard gathered
around him. Unable to resist further, but unwilling to
accept surrender, he and his followers faced the British
cannon. The British, respecting this admirable demonstration
of courage, ceased firing and called out to them,
"Brave Frenchmen, surrender."</p>

<p>The old sergeant, who was about to die, refused to accept
this offer of his life from the enemy. Into the
very muzzles of the British cannon the sergeant hurled
back the offer of his life with one word. That word
was the vilest epithet in the French language. The cannons
roared and the old sergeant and his survivors died
with the word on their lips. Hugo wisely devoted an
entire chapter to that single word.</p>

<p>But I have a new ideal to-day. I found it in the Bois
de Belleau. A small platoon line of Marines lay on their
faces and bellies under the trees at the edge of a wheat
field. Two hundred yards across that flat field the enemy
was located in trees. I peered into the trees but could
see nothing, yet I knew that every leaf in the foliage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
screened scores of German machine guns that swept the
field with lead. The bullets nipped the tops of the young
wheat and ripped the bark from the trunks of the trees
three feet from the ground on which the Marines lay.
The minute for the Marine advance was approaching.
An old gunnery sergeant commanded the platoon in the
absence of the lieutenant, who had been shot and was out
of the fight. This old sergeant was a Marine veteran.
His cheeks were bronzed with the wind and sun of the
seven seas. The service bar across his left breast showed
that he had fought in the Philippines, in Santo Domingo,
at the walls of Pekin, and in the streets of Vera Cruz.
I make no apologies for his language. Even if Hugo
were not my precedent, I would make no apologies. To
me his words were classic, if not sacred.</p>

<p>As the minute for the advance arrived, he arose from
the trees first and jumped out onto the exposed edge of
that field that ran with lead, across which he and his
men were to charge. Then he turned to give the charge
order to the men of his platoon&mdash;his mates&mdash;the men he
loved. He said:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Come on, you sons-o'-bitches! do you want to
live forever?</span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>WOUNDED&mdash;HOW IT FEELS TO BE SHOT</h3>


<p>Just how does it feel to be shot on the field of battle?
Just what is the exact sensation when a bullet
burns its way through your flesh or crashes through your
bones?</p>

<p>I always wanted to know. As a police reporter I
"covered" scores of shooting cases, but I could never
learn from the victims what the precise feeling was as
the piece of lead struck. For long years I had cherished
an inordinate curiosity to know that sensation, if possible,
without experiencing it. I was curious and eager
for enlightenment just as I am still anxious to know how
it is that some people willingly drink buttermilk when it
isn't compulsory.</p>

<p>I am still in the dark concerning the inexplicable taste
for the sour, clotted product of a sweet, well-meaning
cow and the buttery, but I have found out how it feels to
be shot. I know it now by experience.</p>

<p>Three Germans bullets that violated my person left
me as many scars and at the same time completely satisfied
my curiosity. I think now if I can ever muster up
enough courage to drink a glass of buttermilk, I shall
have bereft myself of my last inquisitiveness.</p>

<p>It happened on June 6th just to the northwest of
Château-Thierry in the Bois de Belleau. On the morning
of that day I left Paris by motor for a rush to the front.
The Germans were on that day within forty miles of the
capital of France. On the night before, the citizens of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Paris, in their homes and hotels, had heard the roll of the
guns drawing ever nearer. Many had left the city.</p>

<p>But American divisions were in the line between the
enemy and their goal, and the operation of these divisions
was my object in hustling to the front. On the broad,
paved highway from Paris to Meaux, my car passed miles
and miles of loaded motor trucks bound frontward. Long
lines of these carried thousands of Americans. Other
long lines were loaded down with shells and cartridge
boxes. On the right side of the road, bound for Paris
and points back of the line, was an endless stream of
ambulances and other motor trucks bringing back
wounded. Dense clouds of dust hung like a pall over
the length of the road. The day was hot, the dust was
stifling.</p>

<p>From Meaux we proceeded along the straight highway
that borders the south banks of the Marne to LaFerte,
at which place we crossed the river and turned north to
Montreuil, which was the newly occupied headquarters
of the Second United States Army Division, General
Omar Bundy commanding. On the day before, the two
infantry brigades of that division, one composed of the
5th and 6th U. S. Marines, under command of Brigadier
General Harbord, the other composed of the 9th and
23rd U. S. Infantry, had been thrown into the line which
was just four miles to the north and east.</p>

<p>The fight had been hot during the morning. The
Marines on the left flank of the divisional sector had
been pushing their lines forward through triangle woods
and the village of Lucy-le-Bocage. The information of
their advances was given to me by the Divisional Intelligence
officer, who occupied a large room in the rear
of the building that was used as Divisional Headquarters.
The building was the village <i>Mairie</i>, which also included<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
the village school-house. Now the desks of the school
children were being used by our staff officers and the
walls and blackboards were covered with maps.</p>

<p>I was accompanied by Lieutenant Oscar Hartzell, formerly
of the <i>New York Times</i> staff. We learned that
orders from the French High Command called for a continuation
of the Marine advance during the afternoon
and evening, and this information made it possible for
us to make our plans. Although the Germans were
shelling roads immediately behind the front, Lieutenant
Hartzell and I agreed to proceed by motor from Montreuil
a mile or so to a place called La Voie du Châtel,
which was the headquarters of Colonel Neveille of the
5th Marines. Reaching that place around four o'clock,
we turned a despatch over to the driver of our staff car
with instructions that he proceed with all haste to Paris
and there submit it to the U. S. Press Bureau.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Hartzell and I announced our intentions of
proceeding at once to the front line to Colonel Neveille.</p>

<p>"Go wherever you like," said the regimental commander,
looking up from the outspread maps on the
kitchen table in the low-ceilinged stone farm-house that
he had adopted as headquarters. "Go as far as you like,
but I want to tell you it's damn hot up there."</p>

<p>An hour later found us in the woods to the west of
the village of Lucy le Bocage, in which German shells
were continually falling. To the west and north another
nameless cluster of farm dwellings was in flames. Huge
clouds of smoke rolled up like a smudge against the
background of blue sky.</p>

<p>The ground under the trees in the wood was covered
with small bits of white paper. I could not account for
their presence until I examined several of them and found
that these were letters from American mothers and wives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
and sweethearts&mdash;letters&mdash;whole packages of them,
which the tired, dog-weary Marines had been forced to
remove from their packs and destroy in order to ease the
straps that cut into aching grooves in their shoulders.
Circumstances also forced the abandonment of much other
material and equipment.</p>

<p>Occasional shells were dropping in the woods, which
were also within range from a long distance, indirect machine
gun fire from the enemy. Bits of lead, wobbling in
their flight at the end of their long trajectory, sung
through the air above our heads and clipped leaves and
twigs from the branches. On the edge of the woods we
came upon a hastily dug out pit in which there were
two American machine guns and their crews.</p>

<p>The field in front of the woods sloped gently down
some two hundred yards to another cluster of trees.
This cluster was almost as big as the one we were in.
Part of it was occupied by the Germans. Our machine
gunners maintained a continual fire into that part held
by the enemy.</p>

<p>Five minutes before five o'clock, the order for the
advance reached our pit. It was brought there by a
second lieutenant, a platoon commander.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" he asked, looking at the
green brassard and red "C" on my left arm.</p>

<p>"Looking for the big story," I said.</p>

<p>"If I were you I'd be about forty miles south of this
place," said the Lieutenant, "but if you want to see the
fun, stick around. We are going forward in five
minutes."</p>

<p>That was the last I saw of him until days later, when
both of us, wounded, met in the hospital. Of course, the
first thing he said was, "I told you so."</p>

<p>We hurriedly finished the contents of the can of cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
"Corned Willy" which one of the machine gunners and
I were eating. The machine guns were taken down
and the barrels, cradles and tripods were handed over to
the members of the crew whose duties it was to carry
them.</p>

<p>And then we went over. There are really no heroics
about it. There is no bugle call, no sword waving, no
dramatic enunciation of catchy commands, no theatricalism&mdash;it's
just plain get up and go over. And it is done
just the same as one would walk across a peaceful wheat
field out in Iowa.</p>

<p>But with the appearance of our first line, as it stepped
from the shelter of the woods into the open exposure of
the flat field, the woods opposite began to cackle and rattle
with the enemy machine gun fire. Our men advanced
in open order, ten and twelve feet between men. Sometimes
a squad would run forward fifty feet and drop.
And as its members flattened on the ground for safety
another squad would rise from the ground and make
another rush.</p>

<p>They gained the woods. Then we could hear shouting.
Then we knew that work was being done with the bayonet.
The machine gun fire continued in intensity and
then died down completely. The wood had been won.
Our men consolidated the position by moving forward in
groups ever on the watch-out for snipers in the trees.
A number of these were brought down by our crack pistol
shots.</p>

<p>At different times during the advance runners had come
through the woods inquiring for Major John Berry, the
battalion commander. One of these runners attached
himself to Lieutenant Hartzell and myself and together
the three of us located the Major coming through the
woods. He granted permission for Lieutenant Hartzell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
and me to accompany him and we started forward, in all
a party of some fifteen, including ten runners attached
to the battalion commander.</p>

<p>Owing to the continual evidences of German snipers
in the trees, every one in our party carried a revolver
ready in his hand, with the exception of myself. Correspondents,
you will remember, are non-combatants and
must be unarmed. I carried a notebook, but it was loaded.
We made our way down the slope of the wooded hillside.</p>

<p>Midway down the slope, the hill was bisected by a
sunken road which turned forward on the left. Lying
in the road were a number of French bodies and several
of our men who had been brought down but five minutes
before. We crossed that road hurriedly knowing that it
was covered from the left by German machine guns.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the slope there was a V-shaped field.
The apex of the V was on the left. From left to right
the field was some two hundred yards in width. The
point where we came out of the woods was about one
hundred yards from the apex. At that point the field was
about one hundred yards across. It was perfectly flat and
was covered with a young crop of oats between ten and
fifteen inches high.</p>

<p>This V-shaped oat field was bordered on all sides by
dense clusters of trees. In the trees on the side opposite
the side on which we stood, were German machine
guns. We could hear them. We could not see them but
we knew that every leaf and piece of greenery there vibrated
from their fire and the tops of the young oats
waved and swayed with the streams of lead that swept
across.</p>

<p>Major Berry gave orders for us to follow him at intervals
of ten or fifteen yards. Then he started across the
field alone at the head of the party. I followed. Behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
me came Hartzell. Then the woods about us began
to rattle fiercely. It was unusually close range. That
lead travelled so fast that we could not hear it as it
passed. We soon had visual demonstration of the hot
place we were in when we began to see the dust puffs
that the bullets kicked up in the dirt around our feet.</p>

<p>Major Berry had advanced well beyond the centre of
the field when I saw him turn toward me and heard him
shout:</p>

<p>"Get down everybody."</p>

<p>We all fell on our faces. And then it began to come
hot and fast. Perfectly withering volleys of lead swept
the tops of the oats just over us. For some reason it
did not seem to be coming from the trees hardly a hundred
yards in front of us. It was coming from a new
direction&mdash;from the left.</p>

<p>I was busily engaged flattening myself on the ground.
Then I heard a shout in front of me. It came from Major
Berry. I lifted my head cautiously and looked forward.
The Major was making an effort to get to his feet. With
his right hand he was savagely grasping his left wrist.</p>

<p>"My hand's gone," he shouted. One of the streams of
lead from the left had found him. A ball had entered
his left arm at the elbow, had travelled down the side
of the bone, tearing away muscles and nerves of the forearm
and lodging itself in the palm of his hand. His pain
was excruciating.</p>

<p>"Get down. Flatten out, Major," I shouted, and he
dropped to the ground. I did not know the extent of his
injuries at that time but I did know that he was courting
death every minute he stood up.</p>

<p>"We've got to get out of here," said the Major. "We've
got to get forward. They'll start shelling this open field
in a few minutes."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>I lifted my head for another cautious look.</p>

<p>I judged that I was lying about thirty yards from the
edge of the trees in front of us. The Major was about
ten yards in front of me.</p>

<p>"You are twenty yards from the trees," I shouted to
the Major. "I am crawling over to you now. Wait until
I get there and I'll help you. Then we'll get up and
make a dash for it."</p>

<p>"All right," replied the Major, "hurry along."</p>

<p>I started forward, keeping as flat on the ground as it
was possible to do so and at the same time move. As far
as was feasible, I pushed forward by digging in with my
toes and elbows extended in front of me. It was my
object to make as little movement in the oats as possible.
I was not mistaken about the intensity of fire that swept
the field. It was terrific.</p>

<p>And then it happened. The lighted end of a cigarette
touched me in the fleshy part of my upper left arm. That
was all. It just felt like a sudden burn and nothing worse.
The burned part did not seem to be any larger in area
than that part which could be burned by the lighted end
of a cigarette.</p>

<p>At the time there was no feeling within the arm,
that is, no feeling as to aches or pain. There was nothing
to indicate that the bullet, as I learned several days later,
had gone through the bicep muscle of the upper arm
and had come out on the other side. The only sensation
perceptible at the time was the burning touch at the spot
where the bullet entered.</p>

<p>I glanced down at the sleeve of my uniformed coat and
could not even see the hole where the bullet had entered.
Neither was there any sudden flow of blood. At the time
there was no stiffness or discomfort in the arm and I
continued to use it to work my way forward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the second one hit. It nicked the top of my left
shoulder. And again came the burning sensation, only
this time the area affected seemed larger. Hitting as it
did in the meaty cap of the shoulder, I feared that there
would be no further use for the arm until it had received
attention, but again I was surprised when I found upon
experiment that I could still use it. The bone seemed to
be affected in no way.</p>

<p>Again there was no sudden flow of blood, nor stiffness.
It seemed hard for me to believe at the time, but I had
been shot twice, penetrated through by two bullets and
was experiencing not any more pain than I had experienced
once when I dropped a lighted cigarette on the
back of my hand. I am certain that the pain in no way
approached that sensation which the dentist provides
when he drills into a tooth with a live nerve in it.</p>

<p>So I continued to move toward the Major. Occasionally
I would shout something to him, although, at this
time, I am unable to remember what it was. I only
wanted to let him know I was coming. I had fears, based
on the one look that I had obtained of his pain-distorted
face, that he had been mortally shot in the body.</p>

<p>And then the third one struck me. In order to keep as
close to the ground as possible, I had swung my chin
to the right so that I was pushing forward with my left
cheek flat against the ground and in order to accommodate
this position of the head, I had moved my steel helmet
over so that it covered part of my face on the right.</p>

<p>Then there came a crash. It sounded to me like some
one had dropped a glass bottle into a porcelain bathtub.
A barrel of whitewash tipped over and it seemed that
everything in the world turned white. That was the sensation.
I did not recognise it because I have often been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
led to believe and often heard it said that when one receives
a blow on the head everything turns black.</p>

<p>Maybe I am contrarily constructed, but in my case
everything became pure white. I remember this distinctly
because my years of newspaper training had been
in but one direction&mdash;to sense and remember. So it
was that, even without knowing it, my mind was making
mental notes on every impression that my senses registered.</p>

<p>I did not know yet where I had been hit or what the
bullet had done. I knew that I was still knowing things.
I did not know whether I was alive or dead but I did
know that my mind was still working. I was still mentally
taking notes on every second.</p>

<p>The first recess in that note-taking came when I asked
myself the following question:</p>

<p>"Am I dead?"</p>

<p>I didn't laugh or didn't even smile when I asked myself
the question without putting it in words. I wanted
to know. And wanting to know, I undertook to find out.
I am not aware now that there was any appreciable
passage of time during this mental progress. I feel certain,
however, that I never lost consciousness.</p>

<p>How was I to find out if I was dead? The shock had
lifted my head off the ground but I had immediately
replaced it as close to the soil as possible. My twice
punctured left arm was lying alongside my body. I
decided to try and move my fingers on my left hand. I
did so and they moved. I next moved my left foot. Then
I knew I was alive.</p>

<div class="figcenter2" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/gs13.jpg" width="500" height="341" alt="HELMET WORN BY FLOYD GIBBONS WHEN WOUNDED, SHOWING
DAMAGE CAUSED BY SHRAPNEL" title="" />
<span class="caption">HELMET WORN BY FLOYD GIBBONS WHEN WOUNDED, SHOWING
DAMAGE CAUSED BY SHRAPNEL</span>
</div>

<p>Then I brought my right hand up toward my face
and placed it to the left of my nose. My fingers rested
on something soft and wet. I withdrew the hand and
looked at it. It was covered with blood. As I looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
at it, I was not aware that my entire vision was confined
to my right eye, although there was considerable pain in
the entire left side of my face.</p>

<p>This was sufficient to send me on another mental investigation.
I closed my right eye and&mdash;all was dark. My
first thought following this experiment was that my left
eye was closed. So I again counselled with myself and
tried to open my left eye&mdash;that is, tried to give the mental
command that would cause the muscles of the left eye
to open the lid and close it again.</p>

<p>I did this but could not feel or verify in any way
whether the eye lid responded or not. I only knew that
it remained dark on that side. This brought me to another
conclusion and not a pessimistic one at that. I
simply believed, in spite of the pain, that something had
struck me in the eye and had closed it.</p>

<p>I did not know then, as I know now, that a bullet striking
the ground immediately under my left cheek bone,
had ricocheted upward, going completely through the
left eye and then crashing out through my forehead,
leaving the eyeball and upper eyelid completely halved,
the lower eyelid torn away, and a compound fracture of
the skull.</p>

<p>Further progress toward the Major was impossible.
I must confess that I became so intensely interested in the
weird sensations and subjective research, that I even
neglected to call out and tell the wounded officer that I
would not be able to continue to his assistance. I held
this view in spite of the fact that my original intentions
were strong. Lying there with my left cheek flat on the
ground, I was able to observe some minutes later the
wounded Major rise to his feet and in a perfect hail of
lead rush forward and out of my line of vision.</p>

<p>It was several days later, in the hospital, that I learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
that he reached the shelter of the woods beyond without
being hit again, and in that place, although suffering
intense pain, was able to shout back orders which resulted
in the subsequent wiping out of the machine gun nest
that had been our undoing. For this supreme effort,
General Pershing decorated him with the Distinguished
Service Cross.</p>

<p>I began to make plans to get out of the exposed position
in which I was lying. Whereas the field when I
started across it had seemed perfectly flat, now it impressed
me as being convex and I was further impressed
with the belief that I was lying on the very uppermost
and most exposed curvature of it. There is no doubt
that the continued stream of machine gun lead that swept
the field superinduced this belief. I got as close to the
ground as a piece of paper on top of a table. I remember
regretting sincerely that the war had reached the stage
of open movement and one consequence of which was
that there wasn't a shell hole anywhere to crawl into.</p>

<p>This did not, however, eliminate the dangerous possibility
of shelling. With the fatalism that one acquires
along the fronts, I was ready to take my chances with the
casual German shell that one might have expected, but I
devoted much thought to a consideration of the French
and American artillery some miles behind me. I considered
the possibility of word having been sent back
that our advancing waves at this point had been cut down
by enemy machine gunners who were still in position
preventing all progress at this place. I knew that such
information, if sent back, would immediately be forwarded
to our guns and then a devastating concentration
of shells would be directed toward the location of
the machine gun nests.</p>

<p>I knew that I was lying one hundred yards from one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
of those nests and I knew that I was well within the
fatal bursting radius of any shells our gunners might
direct against that German target. My fear was that
myself and other American wounded lying in that field
would die by American guns. That is what would have
happened if that information had reached our artillery
and it is what should have happened.</p>

<p>The lives of the wounded in that field were as nothing
compared with the importance of wiping out that machine
gun nest on our left which was holding up the entire
advance.</p>

<p>I wanted to see what time it was and my watch was
attached to my left wrist. In endeavouring to get a look
at it, I found out that my left arm was stiff and racked
with pain. Hartzell, I knew, had a watch, but I did not
know where he was lying, so I called out.</p>

<p>He answered me from some distance away but I could
not tell how far or in what direction. I could see dimly
but only at the expense of great pain. When he answered
I shouted back to him:</p>

<p>"Are you hit?"</p>

<p>"No, are you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, what time is it?" I said.</p>

<p>"Are you hit badly?" he asked in reply.</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so," I said. "I think I'm all right."</p>

<p>"Where are you hit?" he asked.</p>

<p>"In the head," I said; "I think something hit my eye."</p>

<p>"In the head, you damn fool," he shouted louder with
just a bit of anger and surprise in his voice. "How the
hell can you be all right if you are hit in the head? Are
you bleeding much?"</p>

<p>"No," I said. "What time is it, will you tell me?"</p>

<p>"I'm coming over to get you," shouted Hartzell.</p>

<p>"Don't move, you damn fool, you want to kill both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
of us?" I hastened to shout back. "If you start moving,
don't move near me. I think they think I'm dead."</p>

<p>"Well you can't lie there and bleed to death," Hartzell
replied. "We've got to do something to get to hell out
of here. What'll we do?"</p>

<p>"Tell me what time it is and how long it will be before
it's dark," I asked.</p>

<p>"It's six o'clock now," Hartzell said, "and it won't be
dark 'til nine; this is June. Do you think you can stick
it out?"</p>

<p>I told him that I thought I could and we were silent
for some time. Both of us had the feeling that other ears&mdash;ears
working in conjunction with eyes trained along
the barrels of those machine guns a hundred yards on our
left&mdash;would be aroused to better marksmanship if we
continued to talk.</p>

<p>I began to take stock of my condition. During my
year or more along the fronts I had been through many
hospitals and from my observations in those institutions
I had cultivated a keen distaste for one thing&mdash;gas gangrene.
I had learned from doctors its fatal and horrible
results and I also had learned from them that it was
caused by germs which exist in large quantities in any
ground that has been under artificial cultivation for a
long period.</p>

<p>Such was the character of the very field I was lying
in and I came to the realisation that the wound in the
left side of my face and head was resting flatly on the
soil. With my right hand I drew up my British box
respirator or gas mask and placed this under my head.
Thus I rested with more confidence, although the machine
gun lead continued to pass in sheets through the tops
of the oats not two or three inches above my head.</p>

<p>All of it was coming from the left,&mdash;coming from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
German nests located in the trees at the apex of the V-shaped
field. Those guns were not a hundred yards away
and they seemed to have an inexhaustible supply of ammunition.
Twenty feet away on my left a wounded
Marine was lying. Occasionally I would open my right
eye for a painful look in his direction.</p>

<p>He was wounded and apparently unconscious. His
pack, "the khaki doll," was still strapped between his
shoulders. Unconsciously he was doing that which all
wounded men do&mdash;that is, to assume the position that
is the most comfortable. He was trying to roll over on
his back.</p>

<p>But the pack was on his back and every time he would
roll over on this it would elevate his body into full view
of the German gunners. Then a withering hail of lead
would sweep the field. It so happened that I was lying
immediately in line between those German guns and this
unconscious moving target. As the Marine would roll
over on top of the pack his chest would be exposed to the
fire.</p>

<p>I could see the buttons fly from his tunic and one of
the shoulder straps of the back pack part as the sprays of
lead struck him. He would limply roll off the pack over on
his side. I found myself wishing that he would lie still,
as every movement of his brought those streams of bullets
closer and closer to my head. I even considered the
thickness of the box respirator on which I had elevated
my head off the ground. It was about two inches thick.</p>

<p>I remembered my French gas mask hanging from my
shoulder and recalled immediately that it was much flatter,
being hardly half an inch in thickness. I forthwith
drew up the French mask to my head, extracted the British
one and rested my cheek closer to the ground on the
French one. Thus, I lowered my head about an inch and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
a half&mdash;an inch and a half that represented worlds of
satisfaction and some optimism to me.</p>

<p>Sometimes there were lulls in the firing. During those
periods of comparative quiet, I could hear the occasional
moan of other wounded on that field. Very few of them
cried out and it seemed to me that those who did were
unconscious when they did it. One man in particular
had a long, low groan. I could not see him, yet I felt
he was lying somewhere close to me. In the quiet
intervals, his unconscious expression of pain reminded
me of the sound I had once heard made by a calf which
had been tied by a short rope to a tree. The animal had
strayed round and round the tree until its entanglements
in the rope had left it a helpless prisoner. The groan of
that unseen, unconscious wounded American who laid
near me on the field that evening sounded exactly like
the pitiful bawl of that calf.</p>

<p>Those three hours were long in passing. With the
successive volleys that swept the field, I sometimes lost
hope that I could ever survive it. It seemed to me that
if three German bullets had found me within the space
of fifteen minutes, I could hardly expect to spend three
hours without receiving the fatal one. With such
thoughts on my mind I reopened conversation with
Hartzell.</p>

<p>"How's it coming, old man?" I shouted.</p>

<p>"They're coming damn close," he said; "how is it with
you? Are you losing much blood?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm all right as far as that goes," I replied, "but
I want you to communicate with my wife, if its 'west'
for me."</p>

<p>"What's her address?" said Hartzell.</p>

<p>"It's a long one," I said. "Are you ready to take it?"</p>

<p>"Shoot," said Hartzell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Mrs. Floyd Gibbons, No. 12 Bis, Rue de la Chevalier
de la Barre, Dijon, Côte d'Or, France.'" I said slowly.</p>

<p>"My God," said Hartzell, "say it again."</p>

<p>Back and forth we repeated the address correctly and
incorrectly some ten or twelve times until Hartzell informed
me that he knew it well enough to sing it. He
also gave me his wife's address. Then just to make
conversation he would shout over, every fifteen minutes,
and tell me that there was just that much less time that
we would have to lie there.</p>

<p>I thought that hour between seven and eight o'clock
dragged the most, but the one between eight and nine
seemed interminable. The hours were so long, particularly
when we considered that a German machine gun
could fire three hundred shots a minute. Dusk approached
slowly. And finally Hartzell called over:</p>

<p>"I don't think they can see us now," he said; "let's start
to crawl back."</p>

<p>"Which way shall we crawl?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Into the woods," said Hartzell.</p>

<p>"Which woods?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The woods we came out of, you damn fool," he replied.</p>

<p>"Which direction are they in?" I said, "I've been moving
around and I don't know which way I am heading.
Are you on my left, or on my right?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell whether I'm on your left or your right,"
he replied. "How are you lying, on your face or on
your back?"</p>

<p>"On my face," I said, "and your voice sounds like
it comes from in back of me and on the left."</p>

<p>"If that's the case," said Hartzell, "your head is lying
toward the wrong woods. Work around in a half circle
and you'll be facing the right direction."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>I did so and then heard Hartzell's voice on my right.
I started moving toward him. Against my better judgment
and expressed wishes, he crawled out toward me
and met me half way. His voice close in front of me
surprised me.</p>

<p>"Hold your head up a little," he said, "I want to see
where it hit you."</p>

<p>"I don't think it looks very nice," I replied, lifting my
head. I wanted to know how it looked myself, so I painfully
opened the right eye and looked through the oats
eighteen inches into Hartzell's face. I saw the look of
horror on it as he looked into mine.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, after crawling painfully through
the interminable yards of young oats, we reached the edge
of the woods and safety.</p>

<p>That's how it feels to be shot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>Weakness from the loss of blood began to grow on
me as Lieutenant Hartzell and I made our way through
the deepening shadows of the wooded hillside in the
rear of the field on which I had been shot. In an upright
position of walking the pains in my head seemed to increase.
We stopped for a minute and, neither of us having
first aid kits with us, I resurrected a somewhat soiled
silk handkerchief with which Hartzell bound up my head
in a manner that applied supporting pressure over my
left eye and brought a degree of relief.</p>

<p>Hartzell told me later that I was staggering slightly
when we reached a small relief dugout about a mile
back of the wood. There a medical corps man removed
the handkerchief and bound my head with a white gauze
bandage. I was anxious to have the wound cleaned
but he told me there was no water. He said they had
been forced to turn it over to the men to drink. This
seemed to me to be as it should be because my thirst was
terrific, yet there was no water left.</p>

<p>We stumbled rearward another half mile and, in the
darkness, came upon the edge of another wooded area.
A considerable number of our wounded were lying on
stretchers on the ground. The Germans were keeping
up a continual fire of shrapnel and high explosive shell
in the woods, apparently to prevent the mobilisation of
reserves, but the doctors, taking care of the wounded,
proceeded with their work without notice to the whine
of the shells passing overhead or the bursting of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
that landed nearby. They went at their work just as
though they were caring for injured men on a football
field.</p>

<p>Hartzell stretched me out on the ground and soon
had a doctor bending over me. The doctor removed the
eye bandage, took one look at what was beneath it and
then replaced it. I remember this distinctly because at
the time I made the mental note that the doctor apparently
considered my head wound beyond anything he could
repair. He next turned his attention to my arm and
shoulder. He inserted his scissors into my left sleeve at
the wrist and ripped it up to the shoulder. He followed
this operation by cutting through my heavy khaki tunic
from the shoulder to the collar. A few more snips of
the nickel-plated blades and my shirt and undershirt
were cut away. He located the three bullet holes, two
in the arm and one across the top of the shoulder, and
bound them up with bandages.</p>

<p>"We're awful shy on ambulances," he said; "you will
have to lie here a while."</p>

<p>"I feel that I can walk all right if there is no reason
why I shouldn't," I replied.</p>

<p>"You ought to be in an ambulance," said the doctor,
"but if you feel that you can make it, you might take a
try at it."</p>

<p>Then turning to Lieutenant Hartzell, he said, "Keep
right with him, and if he begins to get groggy, make
him lie down."</p>

<p>So Hartzell and I resumed our rearward plodding
or staggering. He walked at my right side and slightly
in front of me, holding my right arm over his right
shoulder and thereby giving me considerable support.
We had not proceeded far before we heard the racing
motor of an automobile coming from behind us. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
occasional shell was dropping along the road we were
now on.</p>

<p>A stick struck my legs from behind in the darkness.
And then an apologetic voice said:</p>

<p>"Beg your pardon, sir, just feeling along the road for
shell holes. Ambulance right behind me, sir. Would
you mind stepping to one side? Come on, Bill," to the
driver of the ambulance, "it looks all clear through
here."</p>

<p>The automobile with the racing motor turned out
to be a light ambulance of a popular Detroit make. Its
speeding engine was pure camouflage for its slow progress.
It bubbled and steamed at the radiator cap as it
pushed along at almost a snail's pace.</p>

<p>"All full?" Hartzell shouted into the darkness of the
driver's seat.</p>

<p>"To the brim," responded the driver. "Are you
wounded?"</p>

<p>"No, but I have a wounded man with me," said Hartzell.
"He can sit beside you on the seat if you have room."</p>

<p>"Get right in," said the driver, and Hartzell boosted me
into the front seat. We pushed along slowly, Hartzell
walking beside the car and the driver's assistant proceeding
ahead of us, searching the dark road with his
cane for new shell craters.</p>

<p>Occasionally, when our wheels would strike in one of
these, groans would come from the ambulance proper.</p>

<p>"Take it easy," would come a voice through pain-pressed
lips; "for Christ's sake, do you think you are
driving a truck?"</p>

<p>I heard the driver tell Hartzell that he had three men
with bullet splintered legs in the ambulance. Every jolt
of the car caused their broken bones to jolt and increased
the pounding of their wearied nerves to an extremity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
agony. The fourth occupant of the ambulance, he said,
had been shot through the lungs.</p>

<p>Some distance along, there came a knock on the wooden
partition behind my back,&mdash;the partition that separates
the driver's seat from the ambulance proper. The car
stopped and the driver and Hartzell went to the rear door
and opened it. The man with the shot through the lungs
was half sitting up on his stretcher. He had one hand
to his mouth and his lips, as revealed in the rays of the
driver's flashlight, were red wet.</p>

<p>"Quick&mdash;get me&mdash;to a doctor," the man said between
gulps and gurgles.</p>

<p>The driver considered. He knew we were ten miles
from the closest doctor. Then he addressed himself
to the other three stretcher-cases&mdash;the men with the torture-torn
legs.</p>

<p>"If I go fast, you guys are going to suffer the agonies
of hell," he said, "and if I go slow this guy with the
hemorrhage will croak before we get there. How do you
want me to drive?"</p>

<p>There was not a minute's silence. The three broken
leg cases responded almost in unison.</p>

<p>"Go as fast as you can," they said.</p>

<p>And we did. With Hartzell riding the running board
beside me and the crater finder clinging to the mud
guards on the other side, we sped through the darkness
regardless of the ruts and shell holes. The jolting was
severe but never once did there come another complaint
from the occupants of the ambulance.</p>

<p>In this manner did we arrive in time at the first medical
clearing station. I learned later that the life of the
man with the hemorrhage was saved and he is alive
to-day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>The clearing station was located in an old church on
the outskirts of a little village. Four times during this
war the flow and ebb of battle had passed about this old
edifice. Hartzell half carried me off the ambulance seat
and into the church. As I felt my feet scrape on the flagstoned
flooring underneath the Gothic entrance arch, I
opened my right eye for a painful survey of the interior.</p>

<p>The walls, grey with age, appeared yellow in the light
of the candles and lanterns that were used for illumination.
Blankets, and bits of canvas and carpet had been
tacked over the apertures where once stained glass windows
and huge oaken doors had been. These precautions
were necessary to prevent the lights from shining outside
the building and betraying our location to the hospital-loving
eyes of German bombing 'planes whose motors we
could hear even at that minute, humming in the black
sky above us.</p>

<p>Our American wounded were lying on stretchers all
over the floor. Near the door, where I entered, a number
of pews had been pushed to one side and on these our
walking wounded were seated. They were smoking cigarettes
and talking and passing observations on every
fresh case that came through the door. They all seemed
to be looking at me.</p>

<p>My appearance must have been sufficient to have
shocked them. I was hatless and my hair was matted
with blood. The red-stained bandage around my forehead
and extending down over my left cheek did not
hide the rest of my face, which was unwashed, and consequently
red with fresh blood.</p>

<p>On my left side I was completely bare from the shoulder
to the waist with the exception of the strips of white-cloth
about my arm and shoulder. My chest was splashed
with red from the two body wounds. Such was my entrance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
I must have looked somewhat grewsome because
I happened to catch an involuntary shudder as it passed
over the face of one of my observers among the walking
wounded and I heard him remark to the man next to
him:</p>

<p>"My God, look what they're bringing in."</p>

<p>Hartzell placed me on a stretcher on the floor and
went for water, which I sorely needed. I heard some
one stop beside my stretcher and bend over me, while
a kindly voice said:</p>

<p>"Would you like a cigarette, old man?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied. He lighted one in his own lips
and placed it in my mouth. I wanted to know my benefactor.
I asked him for his name and organisation.</p>

<p>"I am not a soldier," he said; "I am a non-combatant,
the same as you. My name is Slater and I'm from the
Y. M. C. A."</p>

<p>That cigarette tasted mighty good. If you who read
this are one of those whose contributions to the Y. M. C. A.
made that distribution possible, I wish to herewith
express to you my gratefulness and the gratefulness
of the other men who enjoyed your generosity that
night.</p>

<p>In front of what had been the altar in the church,
there had been erected a rudely constructed operation
table. The table was surrounded with tall candelabrum
of brass and gilded wood. These ornate accessories had
been removed from the altar for the purpose of providing
better light for the surgeons who busied themselves
about the table in their long gowns of white&mdash;stained
with red.</p>

<p>I was placed on that table for an examination and I
heard a peculiar conversation going on about me. One
doctor said, "We haven't any more of it." Then another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
doctor said, "But I thought we had plenty." The
first voice replied, "Yes, but we didn't expect so many
wounded. We have used up all we had." Then the
second voice said, "Well, we certainly need it now. I
don't know what we're going to do without it."</p>

<p>From their further conversation I learned that the
subject under discussion was anti-tetanus serum&mdash;the
all-important inoculation that prevents lockjaw and is
also an antidote for the germs of gas gangrene. You
may be sure I became more than mildly interested in the
absence of this valuable boon, but there was nothing I
could say that would help the case, so I remained quiet. In
several minutes my composure was rewarded. I heard
hurried footsteps across the flagstoned flooring and a
minute later felt a steel needle penetrating my abdomen.
Then a cheery voice said:</p>

<p>"It's all right, now, we've got plenty of it. We've
got just piles of it. The Red Cross just shot it out from
Paris in limousines."</p>

<p>After the injection Hartzell informed me that the
doctors could do nothing for me at that place and that
I was to be moved further to the rear. He said ambulances
were scarce but he had found a place for me in a
returning ammunition truck. I was carried out of the
church and somewhere in the outer darkness was lifted
up into the body of the truck and laid down on some straw
in the bottom. There were some fifteen or twenty other
men lying there beside me.</p>

<p>The jolting in this springless vehicle was severe, but
its severity was relieved in some of our cases by the quieting
injections we had received. The effects of these narcotics
had worn off in some of the men and they suffered
the worse for it. One of them continually called out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
to the truck driver to go slower and make less jolting.
To each request the driver responded that he was going
as slow as he could. As the jolting continued the man
with the complaining nerves finally yelled out a new
request. He said:</p>

<p>"Well, if you can't make it easier by going slow, then
for God's sake throw her into high and go as fast as you
can. Let's get it over as quick as we can."</p>

<p>Lying on my back in the truck with a raincoat as a
pillow, I began to wonder where we were bound for.
I opened my eye once and looked up toward the roof of
the leafy tunnel which covered the road. Soon we passed
out from beneath the trees bordering the roadside and
I could see the sky above. The moon was out and
there were lots of stars. They gave one something to
think about. After all, how insignificant was one little
life.</p>

<p>In this mood, something in the jolting of the camion
brought to my mind the metre and words of George
Amicks' wistful verses, "The Camion Caravan," and I
repeat it from memory:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Winding down through sleeping town<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pale stars of early dawn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like ancient knight with squire by side,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Sometime during the dark hours of the early morning
we stopped in the courtyard of a hospital and I was taken
into another examination room illuminated with painfully
brilliant lights. I was placed on a table for an
examination, which seemed rather hurried, and then the
table was rolled away some distance down a corridor.
I never understood that move until some weeks later
when a Lieutenant medical officer told me that it was he
who had examined me at that place.</p>

<p>"You're looking pretty fit, now," he said, "but that
night when I saw you I ticketed you for the dead pile.
You didn't look like you could live till morning."</p>

<p>His statement gave me some satisfaction. There is
always joy in fooling the doctor.</p>

<p>Hartzell, who still accompanied me, apparently rescued
me from the "dead pile" and we started on another
motor trip, this time on a stretcher in a large, easier-riding
ambulance. In this I arrived shortly after dawn
at the United States Military Base Hospital at Neuilly-sur-Seine,
on the outskirts of Paris.</p>

<p>There were more hurried examinations and soon I
was rolled down a corridor on a wheeled table, into an
elevator that started upward. Then the wheeled table
raced down another long corridor and I began to feel
that my journeyings were endless. We stopped finally
in a room where I distinctly caught the odour of ether.
Some one began removing my boots and clothes. As
that some one worked he talked to me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know you, Mr. Gibbons," he said. "I'm from Chicago
also. I am Sergeant Stephen Hayes. I used to go
to Hyde Park High School. We're going to fix you up
right away."</p>

<p>I learned from Hayes that I was lying in a room adjoining
the operating chamber and was being prepared
for the operating table. Some information concerning
the extent of my injuries and the purpose of the operation
would have been comforting and would have relieved
the sensation of utter helpless childishness that I was
experiencing.</p>

<p>I knew I was about to go under the influence of
the anesthetic and that something was going to be done
to me. I had every confidence that whatever was done
would be for the best but it was perfectly natural that I
should be curious about it. Was the operation to be
a serious one or a minor one? Would they have to remove
my eye? Would they have to operate on my skull?
How about the arm? Would there be an amputation?
How about the other eye? Would I ever see again?
It must be remembered that in spite of all the examinations
I had not been informed and consequently had no
knowledge concerning the extent of my injuries. The
only information I had received had been included in
vague remarks intended as soothing, such as "You're all
right, old man." "You'll pull through fine." "You're
coming along nicely." But all of it had seemed too professionally
optimistic to satisfy me and my doubts still
remained.</p>

<p>They were relieved, however, by the pressure of a hand
and the sound of a voice. In the words spoken and in
the pressure of the hand, there was hardly anything different
from similar hand pressures and similar spoken
phrases that had come to me during the night, yet there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
was everything different. This voice and this hand carried
supreme confidence. I could believe in both of them.
I felt the hand pressure on my right shoulder and the
mild kindly voice said:</p>

<p>"Son, I am going to operate on you. I have examined
you and you are all right. You are going to come
through fine. Don't worry about anything."</p>

<p>"Thank you, very much," I said, "I like your voice.
It sounds like my father's. Will you tell me your name?"</p>

<p>"I am Major Powers," the kindly voice said. "Now
just take it easy, and I will talk to you again in a couple
of hours when you feel better."</p>

<p>The speaker, as I learned later, was Major Charles
Powers, of Denver, Colorado, one of the best-known and
best-loved surgeons in the West. A man far advanced
in his profession and well advanced in his years, a man
whose life has not been one of continual health, a man
who, upon America's entry of the war, sacrificed the
safety of the beneficial air rarity of his native Denver
to answer the country's call, to go to France at great
personal risk to his health&mdash;a risk only appreciated by
those who know him well. It was Major Powers who
operated upon the compound fracture in my skull that
morning.</p>

<p>My mental note-taking continued as the anesthetist
worked over me with the ether. As I began breathing
the fumes I remember that my senses were keenly making
observations on every sensation I experienced. The
thought even went through my mind that it would be
rather an unusual thing to report completely the impressions
of coma. This suggestion became a determination
and I became keyed up to everything going on
about me.</p>

<p>The conversation of the young doctor who was administering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
the anesthetic interested me unusually. He
was very busy and business-like and although I considered
myself an important and most interested party
in the entire proceedings, his conversation ignored me
entirely. He not only did not talk to me, but he was not
even talking about me. As he continued to apply the
ether, he kept up a running fire of entirely extraneous
remarks with some other person near the table. I did
not appreciate then, as I do now, that I was only one
of very, very many that he had anesthetised that morning
and the night before, but at the time his seeming lack
of all interest in me as me, piqued me considerably.</p>

<p>"Are you feeling my pulse?" I said. I could not
feel his hand on either of my wrists, but I asked the
question principally to inject myself into the conversation
in some way or other, preferably in some way that
would call him to account, as I had by this time aroused
within me a keen and healthy dislike for this busy little
worker whom I could not see but who stood over me
and carried on conversations with other people to my
utter and complete exclusion. And all the time he was
engaged in feeding me the fumes that I knew would soon
steal away my senses.</p>

<p>"Now, never you mind about your pulse," he replied
somewhat peevishly. "I'm taking care of this."
It seemed to me from the tone of his voice that he implied
I was talking about something that was none of
my business and I had the distinct conviction that if
the proceedings were anybody's business, they certainly
were mine.</p>

<p>"You will pardon me for manifesting a mild interest
in what you are doing to me," I said, "but you see I
know that something is going to be done to my right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
eye and inasmuch as that is the only eye I've got on that
side, I can't help being concerned."</p>

<p>"Now, you just forget it and take deep breaths, and
say, Charlie, did you see that case over in Ward 62?
That was a wonderful case. The bullet hit the man in
the head and they took the lead out of his stomach.
He's got the bullet on the table beside him now. Talk
about bullet eaters&mdash;believe me, those Marines sure are."</p>

<p>I hurled myself back into the conversation.</p>

<p>"I'll take deep breaths if you'll loosen the straps over
my chest," I said, getting madder each minute. "How
can I take a full breath when you've got my lungs
strapped down?"</p>

<p>"Well, how's that?" responded the conversational
anesthetist, as he loosened one of the straps. "Now,
take one breath of fresh air&mdash;one deep, long breath,
now."</p>

<p>I turned my head to one side to escape the fumes from
the stifling towel over my face and made a frenzied gulp
for fresh air. As I did so, one large drop of ether fell
on the table right in front of my nose and the deep
long breath I got had very little air in it. I felt I had
been tricked.</p>

<p>"You're pretty cute, old timer, aren't you?" I remarked
to the anesthetist for the purpose of letting him
know that I was on to his game, but either he didn't
hear me, or he was too interested in telling Charlie about
his hopes and ambitions to be sent to the front with a
medical unit that worked under range of the guns. He
returned to a consideration of me with the following
remark:</p>

<p>"All right, he's under now; where's the next one?"</p>

<p>"The hell I am," I responded hastily, as visions of
knives and saws and gimlets and brain chisels went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
through my mind. I had no intention or desire of being
conscious when the carpenters and plumbers started to
work on me.</p>

<p>I was completely ignored and the table started moving.
We rolled across the floor and there commenced a clicking
under the back of my head, not unlike the sound made
when the barber lowers or elevates the head-rest on his
chair. The table rolled seemingly a long distance down
a long corridor and then came to the top of a slanting
runway.</p>

<p>As I started riding the table down the runway I began
to see that I was descending an inclined tube which
seemed to be filled with yellow vapour. Some distance
down, the table slowed up and we came to a stop in
front of a circular bulkhead in the tunnel.</p>

<p>There was a door in the centre of the bulkhead and
in the centre of the door there was a small wicket window
which opened and two grotesquely smiling eyes
peered out at me. Those eyes inspected me from head
to foot and then, apparently satisfied, they twinkled and
the wicket closed with a snap. Then the door opened
and out stepped a quaint and curious figure with gnarled
limbs and arms and a peculiar misshapen head, completely
covered with a short growth of black hair.</p>

<p>I laughed outright, laughed hilariously. I recognised
the man. The last time I had seen him was when he
stepped out of a gas tank on the 18th floor of an office
building in Chicago where I was reclining at the time
in a dentist chair. He was the little gas demon who
walked with me through the Elysian fields the last time
I had a tooth pulled.</p>

<p>"Well you poor little son-of-a-gun," I said, by way of
greeting. "What are you doing way over here in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
France? I haven't seen you for almost two years, since
that day back in Chicago."</p>

<p>The gas demon rolled his head from one side to the
other and smiled, but I can't remember what he said.
My mental note-taking concluded about there because
the next memory I have is of complete darkness, and lying
on my back in a cramped position while a horse
trampled on my left arm.</p>

<p>"Back off of there," I shouted, but the animal's hoofs
didn't move. The only effect my shouting had was
to bring a soft hand into my right one, and a sweet
voice close beside me.</p>

<p>"You're all right, now," said the sweet voice, "just
try to take a little nap and you'll feel better."</p>

<p>Then I knew it was all over, that is, the operation was
over, or something was over. Anyhow my mind was
working and I was in a position where I wanted to know
things again. I recall now, with a smile, that the first
things that passed through my mind were the threadbare
bromides so often quoted "Where am I?" I recall feeling
the urge to say something at least original, so I
enquired:</p>

<p>"What place is this, and will you please tell me what
day and time it is?"</p>

<p>"This is the Military Base Hospital at Neuilly-sur-Seine
just on the outskirts of Paris, and it is about
eleven o'clock in the morning and to-day is Friday, June
the seventh."</p>

<p>Then I went back to sleep with an etherised taste in
my mouth like a motorman's glove.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>GROANS, LAUGHS AND SOBS IN THE HOSPITAL</h3>


<p>There were fourteen wounded American soldiers in
my ward&mdash;all men from the ranks and representing
almost as many nationalistic extractions. There was an
Irishman, a Swede, an Italian, a Jew, a Pole, one man
of German parentage, and one man of Russian extraction.
All of them had been wounded at the front and
all of them now had something nearer and dearer to them
than any traditions that might have been handed down to
them from a mother country&mdash;they had fought and
bled and suffered for a new country, <i>their</i> new country.</p>

<p>Here in this ward was the new melting pot of America.
Not the melting pot of our great American cities where
nationalistic quarters still exist, but a greater fusion
process from which these men had emerged with unquestionable
Americanism. They are the real and the
new Americans&mdash;born in the hell of battle.</p>

<p>One night as we lay there, we heard an automobile
racing through a street in this sleepy, warm little
<i>faubourg</i> of Paris. The motor was sounding on its
siren a call that was familiar to all of us. It was the
alarm of a night attack from the air. It meant that
German planes had crossed the front line and were on
their way with death and destruction for Paris.</p>

<p>A nurse entered the room and drew the curtains of
the tall windows to keep from our eyes the flash and the
glitter of the shells that soon began to burst in the sky
above us as the aerial defences located on the outer circle
of the city began to erect a wall of bursting steel around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
the French capital. We could hear the guns barking
close by and occasionally the louder boom that told us
one of the German bombs had landed. Particles of
shrapnel began falling in the garden beneath the windows
of our ward and we could hear the rattle of the pieces
on the slate roof of a pavilion there. It is most unpleasant,
it goes without saying, to lie helpless on one's
back and grapple with the realisation that directly over
your head&mdash;right straight above your eyes and face&mdash;is
an enemy airplane loaded with bombs. Many of us
knew that those bombs contained, some of them, more
than two hundred pounds of melilite and some of us
had witnessed the terrific havoc they wrought when they
landed on a building. All of us knew, as the world
knows, the particular attraction that hospitals have for
German bombs.</p>

<p>The aerial bombardment subsided after some ten or
fifteen minutes and soon we heard the motor racing back
through the streets while a musician in the car sounded
on a bugle the "prologue" or the signal that the raid
was over. The invaders had been driven back. All of
us in the ward tried to sleep. But nerves tingled from
this more or less uncomfortable experience and wounds
ached and burned. Sleep was almost out of the question,
and in the darkened ward I soon noticed the red
glow of cigarette after cigarette from bed to bed as the
men sought to woo relief with tobacco smoke.</p>

<p>We began to discuss a subject very near and very dear
to all wounded men. That is, what they are going to
do as soon as they get out of the hospital. It is known,
of course, that the first consideration usually is, to return
to the front, but in many instances in our ward,
this was entirely out of the question.</p>

<p>So it was with Dan Bailey who occupied a bed two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
beds on my right. His left leg was off above the knee.
He lost it going over the top at Cantigny.</p>

<p>"I know what I'm going to do when I get home," he
said, "I am going to get a job as an instructor in a
roller skating rink."</p>

<p>In a bed on the other side of the ward was a young
man with his right arm off. His name was Johnson
and he had been a musician. In time of battle, musicians
lay aside their trombones and cornets and go over the
top with the men, only they carry stretchers instead of
rifles. Johnson had done this. Something had exploded
quite close to him and his entire recollection of
the battle was that he had awakened being carried back
on his own stretcher.</p>

<p>"I know where I can sure get work," he said, glancing
down at the stump of his lost arm. "I am going to
sign up as a pitcher with the St. Louis Nationals."</p>

<p>Days later when I looked on Johnson for the first time,
I asked him if he wasn't Irish, and he said no. Then
I asked him where he lost his arm and he replied, "At
the yoint." And then I knew where he came from.</p>

<p>But concerning after-the-war occupations, I endeavoured
that night to contribute something in a similar
vein to the general discussion, and I suggested the possibility
that I might return to give lessons on the monocle.</p>

<p>The prize prospect, however, was submitted by a man
who occupied a bed far over in one corner of the room.
He was the possessor of a polysyllabic name&mdash;a name
sprinkled with k's, s's and z's, with a scarcity of vowels&mdash;a
name that we could not pronounce, much less remember.
On account of his size we called him "Big
Boy." His was a peculiar story.</p>

<p>He had been captured by three Germans who were
marching him back to their line. In telling me the story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
Big Boy said, "Mr. Gibbons, I made up my mind as I
walked back with them that I might just as well be dead
as to spend the rest of the war studying German."</p>

<p>So he had struck the man on the right and the one on
the left and had downed both of them, but the German
in back of him, got him with the bayonet. A nerve
centre in his back was severed by the slash of the steel
that extended almost from one shoulder to the other, and
Big Boy had fallen to the ground, his arms and legs
powerless. Then the German with the bayonet robbed
him. Big Boy enumerated the loss to me,&mdash;fifty-three
dollars and his girl's picture.</p>

<p>Although paralysed and helpless, there was nothing
down in the mouth about Big Boy&mdash;indeed, he provided
most of the fun in the ward. He had an idea all of
his own about what he was going to do after the war
and he let us know about it that night.</p>

<p>"All of you guys have told what you're going to do,"
he said, "now I'm going to tell you the truth. I'm going
back to that little town of mine in Ohio and go down
to the grocery store and sit there on a soap box on the
porch.</p>

<p>"Then I'm going to gather all the little boys in the
neighbourhood round about me and then I'm going to
outlie the G. A. R."</p>

<p>There was one thing in that ward that nobody could lie
about and that was the twitches of pain we suffered in
the mornings when the old dressings of the day before
were changed and new ones applied.</p>

<p>The doctor and his woman assistant who had charge
of the surgical dressings on that corridor would arrive
in the ward shortly after breakfast. They would be
wheeling in front of them a rubber-tired, white-enamelled
vehicle on which were piled the jars of antiseptic gauze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
and trays of nickel-plated instruments, which both the
doctor and his assistant would handle with rubber-gloved
hands. In our ward that vehicle was known as the
"Agony Cart," and every time it stopped at the foot of
a bed you would be pretty sure to hear a groan or a stifled
wail in a few minutes.</p>

<p>We had various ways of expressing or suppressing the
pain. You who have had a particularly vicious mustard
plaster jerked off that tender spot in the back, right
between the shoulders, have some small conception of
the delicate sensation that accompanies the removal of old
gauze from a healing wound.</p>

<p>Some of the men would grit their teeth and grunt,
others would put their wrists in their mouths and bite
themselves during the operation. Some others would
try to keep talking to the doctor or the nurse while the
ordeal was in progress and others would just simply
shout. There was little satisfaction to be gained from
these expressions of pain because while one man was
yelling the other thirteen in the ward were shouting with
glee and chaffing him, and as soon as his wounds had
been redressed he would join in the laughs at the expense
of those who followed him.</p>

<p>There was a Jewish boy in the ward and he had a particularly
painful shell wound in his right leg. He was
plucky about the painful treatment and used to say to
the doctor, "Don't mind me yelling, doc. I can't help it,
but you just keep right on."</p>

<p>The Jew boy's cry of pain as near as I can reproduce
it went something like this, "Oy! Oy!! Oy!!! YOY!!!
Doctor!"</p>

<p>The Jew boy's clear-toned enunciation of this Yiddish
lullaby, as the rest of the ward called it, brought many
a heartless, fiendish laugh from the occupants of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
other beds. We almost lost one of our patients on
account of that laugh. He nearly laughed himself to
death&mdash;in fact.</p>

<p>This near victim of uncontrollable risibilities was an
Italian boy from the East Side of New York. A piece
of shrapnel had penetrated one of his lungs and pleurisy
had developed in the other one. It had become necessary
to operate on one of the lungs and tape it down.
The boy had to do his best to breathe with one lung that
was affected by pleurisy. Every breath was like the
stab of a knife and it was quite natural that the patient
would be peevish and garrulous. The whole ward called
him the "dying Wop." But his name was Frank.</p>

<p>When the Jew boy would run the scale with his torture
cry, the "dying Wop" would be forced to forget his
laboured breathing and give vent to laughter. These
almost fatal laughs sounded something like this:</p>

<p>"He! Hee!! Hee!!! (on a rising inflection and then
much softer) Oh, Oh, Oh! Stop him, stop him, stop
him!" The "He-Hee's" were laughs, but the "Oh-oh's"
were excruciating pain.</p>

<p>Frank grew steadily worse and had to be removed
from the ward. Weeks afterward I went back to see
him and found him much thinner and considerably
weaker. He occupied a bed on one of the pavilions in
the garden. He was still breathing out of that one
lung and between gasps he told me that six men had
died in the bed next to him. Then he smiled up at
me with a look in his eyes that seemed to say, "But
they haven't croaked the 'dying Wop' yet."</p>

<p>"This here&mdash;hospital stuff&mdash;&mdash;" Frank told me slowly,
and between gasps, "is the big fight after all. I know&mdash;I
am fighting here&mdash;against death&mdash;and am going to win
out, too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm going to win out even though it is harder to
fight&mdash;than fighting&mdash;the Germans&mdash;up front. We Italians
licked Hell out of them&mdash;a million years ago. Old
General Cæsar did it and he used to bring them back
to Rome and put 'em in white-wing suits on the streets."</p>

<p>For all his quaint knowledge of Cæsar's successes
against the progenitors of Kulturland of to-day, Frank
was all American. Here was a rough-cut young American
from the streets of New York's Little Italy. Here
was a man who had almost made the supreme sacrifice.
Here was a man who, if he did escape death, faced long
weakened years ahead. It occurred to me that I would
like to know, that it would be interesting to know, in
what opinion this wounded American soldier, the son
of uneducated immigrant parents, would hold the Chief
Executive of the United States, the man he would most
likely personify as responsible for the events that led
up to his being wounded on the battlefield.</p>

<p>"Frank," I asked, "what do you think about the President
of the United States?"</p>

<p>He seemed to be considering for a minute, or maybe
he was only waiting to gather sufficient breath to make
an answer. He had been lying with his eyes directed
steadfastly toward the ceiling. Now he turned his face
slowly toward me. His eyes, sunken slightly in their
sockets, shone feverishly. His pinched, hollow cheeks
were still swarthy, but the background of the white pillow
made them look wan. Slowly he moistened his lips,
and then he said:</p>

<p>"Say&mdash;say&mdash;that guy&mdash;that guy's&mdash;got hair&mdash;on his
chest."</p>

<p>That was the opinion of the "dying Wop."</p>

<p>After Frank's removal from our ward, the rest of us
frequently sent messages of cheer down to him. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
messages were usually carried by a young American
woman who had a particular interest in our ward. Not
strange to say, she had donned a Red Cross nursing
uniform on the same day that most of us arrived in that
ward. She was one of the American women who
brought us fruit, ice cream, candy and cigarettes. She
wrote letters for us to our mothers. She worked long
hours, night and day, for us. In her absence, one day,
the ward went into session and voted her its guardian
angel. Out of modesty, I was forced to answer "Present"
instead of "Aye" to the roll-call. The Angel was
and is my wife.</p>

<p>As Official Ward Angel it was among the wife's duties
to handle the matter of visitors, of which there were
many. It seemed, during those early days in June, that
every American woman in France dropped whatever war
work she was doing and rushed to the American hospitals
to be of whatever service she could. And it was not
easy work these women accomplished. There was very
little "forehead-rubbing" or "moving picture nursing."
Much of it was tile corridor scrubbing and pan cleaning.
They stopped at no tasks they were called upon to perform.
Many of them worked themselves sick during
the long hours of that rush period.</p>

<p>Sometimes the willingness, eagerness and sympathy
of some of the visitors produced humourous little incidents
in our hospital life. Nearly all of the women entering
our ward would stop at the foot of "Big Boy's"
bed. They would learn of his paralysed condition from
the chart attached to the foot of the bed. Then they
would mournfully shake their heads and slowly pronounce
the words "Poor boy."</p>

<p>And above all things in the world distasteful to Big
Boy was that one expression "Poor boy" because as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
soon as the kindly intentioned women would leave the
room, the rest of the ward would take up the "Poor boy"
chorus until Big Boy got sick of it. Usually, however,
before leaving the ward the woman visitor would take
from a cluster of flowers on her arm, one large red rose
and this she would solemnly deposit on Big Boy's defenceless
chest.</p>

<p>Big Boy would smile up to her a look which she would
accept and interpret as one of deep, undying gratitude.
The kindly-intentioned one surrounding herself with
that benediction that is derived from a sacred duty well
performed, would walk slowly from the room and as
the door would close behind her, Big Boy's gruff drawling
voice would sing out in a call for the orderly.</p>

<p>"Dan, remove the funeral decorations," he would
order.</p>

<p>Dan Sullivan, our orderly, was the busiest man in
the hospital. Big Boy liked to smoke, but, being paralysed,
he required assistance. At regular intervals during
the day the ward room door, which was close to Big
Boy's bed, would open slowly and through the gap four
or six inches wide the rest of the ward would get a
glimpse of Dan standing in the opening with his arms
piled high with pots and utensils, and a cigarette hanging
from the corner of his mouth.</p>

<div class="figcenter2" style="width: 500px;">

<img src="images/gs15.jpg" width="500" height="323" alt="SMILING WOUNDED AMERICAN SOLDIERS" title="" />
<span class="caption">SMILING WOUNDED AMERICAN SOLDIERS</span>
</div>

<p>With one hand he would extract the cigarette, insert
hand and arm through the opening in the door until it
hovered above Big Boy's face. Then the hand would
descend and the cigarette would be inserted in Big Boy's
mouth just as you would stick a pin in a pin-cushion.
Big Boy would lie back comfortably and puff away like
a Mississippi steamboat for four or five minutes and
then the door would open just a crack again, the mysterious
hand and arm would reach in once more and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
cigarette would be plucked out. That was the way Big
Boy got his "smokes."</p>

<p>If Big Boy's voice was gruff, there was still a gruffer
voice that used to come from a man in the corner of
the ward to the left of my bed. During the first four
or five days I was an inmate of the ward, I was most
interested in all the voices I heard because I lay in total
darkness. The bandages extended down from the top of
my head to my upper lip, and I did not know whether or
not I ever would see again. I would listen carefully to
all remarks within ear-shot, whether they be from doctors,
nurses or patients. I listened in the hope that from
them I might learn whether or not there was a possibility
of my regaining vision. But all of their remarks with
regard to my condition were ambiguous and unsatisfactory.
But from this I gained a listening habit and that
was how I became particularly interested in the very
gruff voice that came from the corner on my left.</p>

<p>Other patients directing remarks into that corner would
address them to a man whom they would call by name
"Red Shannahan." I was quick to connect the gruff
voice and the name "Red Shannahan," and as I had
lots of time and nothing else to do, I built up in my
mind's eye a picture of a tall, husky, rough and ready,
tough Irishman, with red hair&mdash;a man of whom it
would be conceivable that he had wiped out some two
or three German regiments before they got him. To find
out more about this character, I called over to him one
day.</p>

<p>"Red Shannahan, are you there?" I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Gibbons, I'm here," came the reply, and I
was immensely surprised because it was not the gruff voice
at all. It was the mild, unchanged voice of a boy, a boy
whose tones were still in the upper register. The reply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
seemed almost girlish in comparison with the gruffer
tones of the other patients and I marvelled that the owner
of this polite, mannerly, high-pitched voice could be
known by any such name as "Red Shannahan." I determined
upon further investigation.</p>

<p>"Red Shannahan, what work did you do before you
became a United States soldier?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gibbons," came the reply, almost girlishly, "I
am from Baltimore. I drove the wagon for Mr. Bishop,
the canary bird and gold fish man."</p>

<p>All that had happened to this canary bird fancier and
gold fish tamer was that he had killed two Germans and
captured three before they got him.</p>

<p>Among those who came to visit us in that ward, there
appeared one day a man I had not seen in many years.
When I knew him last he had been a sport-loving fellow-student
of mine at college and one of the fastest, hardest-fighting
ends our 'Varsity football squad ever had.
Knowing this disposition of the man, I was quite surprised
to see on the sleeve of his khaki service uniform
the red shield and insignia of the Knights of Columbus.</p>

<p>I was well aware of the very valuable work done by
this institution wherever American soldiers are in France,
but I could not imagine this former college chum of
mine being engaged in such work instead of being in
the service. He noticed my silence and he said, "Gib,
do you remember that game with the Indians on
Thanksgiving Day?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, "they hurt your leg that day."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied my old college mate, whom we might
as well call MacDougal inasmuch as that was not his
name. "Yes, they took that leg away from me three
years later."</p>

<p>I knew then why MacDougal was with the K. C. and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
I wondered what service he would perform in our ward
in the name of his organisation. I soon found out.
Without introduction, MacDougal proceeded to the bedside
of Dan Bailey, the Infantryman with one leg off,
who was lying in a bed on my right. MacDougal walked
back and forth two or three times past the foot of
Bailey's bed.</p>

<p>"How does that look?" he said to Bailey. "Do I
walk all right?"</p>

<p>"Looks all right to me," replied Bailey; "what's the
matter with you?"</p>

<p>MacDougal then began jumping, skipping and hopping
up and down and across the floor at the foot of Bailey's
bed. Finishing these exercises breathlessly, he again addressed
himself to the sufferer with one leg.</p>

<p>"How did that look?" he said. "Did that look all
right?"</p>

<p>"I don't see anything the matter with you," replied
Bailey, "unless it is that you're in the wrong ward."</p>

<p>Then MacDougal stood close by Bailey's bedside where
the boy with one leg could watch him closely. MacDougal
took his cane and struck his own right leg a
resounding whack. And we all knew by the sound of
the blow that the leg he struck was wooden.</p>

<p>In that peculiar way did MacDougal bring into the
life of Dan Bailey new interest and new prospects. He
proved to Dan Bailey that for the rest of his life Dan
Bailey with an artificial limb could walk about and jump
and skip and hop almost as well as people with two
good legs. That was the service performed by the
Knights of Columbus in our ward.</p>

<p>There was one other organisation in that hospital that
deserves mention. It was the most exclusive little clique
and rather inclined towards snobbishness. I was a member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
of it. We used to look down on the ordinary
wounded cases that had two eyes. We enjoyed, either
rightly or wrongly, a feeling of superiority. Death
comes mighty close when it nicks an eye out of your
head. All of the one-eyed cases and some of the no-eyed
cases received attention in one certain ward, and it
was to this ward after my release from the hospital that
I used to go every day for fresh dressings for my
wounds. Every time I entered the ward a delegation
of one-eyed would greet me as a comrade and present
me with a petition. In this petition I was asked and
urged to betake myself to the hospital library, to probe
the depths of the encyclopædias and from their wordy
innards tear out one name for the organisation of the
one-eyed. This was to be our life long club, they said,
and the insistence was that the name above all should
be a "classy" name. So it came to pass that after much
research and debate one name was accepted and from that
time on we became known as the Cyclops Club.</p>

<p>A wonderful Philadelphia surgeon was in charge of
the work in that ward. Hundreds of American soldiers
for long years after the war will thank him for seeing.
I thank him for my sight now. His name is Dr. Fewell.
The greatest excitement in the ward prevailed one day
when one of the doctor's assistants entered carrying
several flat, hard wood cases, each of them about a yard
square. The cases opened like a book and were laid flat
on the table. Their interiors were lined with green velvet
and there on the shallow receptacles in the green
velvet were just dozens of eyes, gleaming unblinkingly
up at us.</p>

<p>A shout went up and down the ward and the Cyclopians
gathered around the table. There was a grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
grab right and left. Everybody tried to get a handful.
There was some difficulty reassorting the grabs. Of
course, it happened, that fellows that really needed blue
or grey ones, managed to get hold of black ones or
brown ones, and some confusion existed while they
traded back and forth to match up proper colours, shades
and sizes.</p>

<p>One Cyclopian was not in on the grab. In addition
to having lost one eye, he had received about a pound
and a half of assorted hardware in his back, and these
flesh wounds confined him to his bed. He had been
sleeping and he suddenly awoke during the distribution
of the glassware. He apparently became alarmed with
the thought that he was going to be left out of consideration.
I saw him sit bolt upright in bed as he shouted
clear across the ward:</p>

<p>"Hey, Doc, pass the grapes."</p>

<p>When it became possible for me to leave that hospital,
I went to another one three blocks away. This was
a remarkable institution that had been maintained by
wealthy Americans living in France before the war. I
was assigned to a room on the third floor&mdash;a room adjoining
a sun parlour, overlooking a beautiful Old World
garden with a lagoon, rustic bridges, trees and shrubbery.</p>

<p>In early June, when that flood of American wounded
had come back from the Marne, it had become necessary
to erect hospital ward tents in the garden and there a
number of our wounded were cared for. I used to
notice that every day two orderlies would carry out from
one of the small tents a small white cot on which there
lay an American soldier. They would place the cot
on the green grass where the sunlight, finding its way
through the leafy branches of the tree, would shine down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
upon the form of this young&mdash;this very young&mdash;fighter
from the U. S. A.</p>

<p>He was just two months over seventeen years of age.
He had deliberately and patriotically lied one year on
his age in order that he might go to France and fight
beneath our flag.</p>

<p>He was wounded, but his appearance did not indicate
how badly. There were no bandages about his head,
arms or body. There was nothing to suggest the severity
of his injuries&mdash;nothing save his small round spot on
the side of his head where the surgeons had shaved away
the hair&mdash;just a small round spot that marked the place
where a piece of German hand-grenade had touched the
skull.</p>

<p>This little fellow had forgotten everything. He could
not remember&mdash;all had slipped his mind save for the
three or four lines of one little song, which was the sole
remaining memory that bridged the gap of four thousand
miles between him and his home across the sea.</p>

<p>Over and over again he would sing it all day long as
he lay there on the cot with the sunlight streaming all
over him. His sweet boyish voice would come up
through the leafy branches to the windows of my room.</p>

<p>I frequently noticed my nurse standing there at the
window listening to him. Then I would notice that
her shoulders would shake convulsively and she would
walk out of the room, wet eyed but silent. And the
song the little fellow sang was this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Just try to picture me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back home in Tennessee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right by my mother's knee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She thinks the world of me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She will be there to meet me<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With a hug and kiss she'll greet me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I get back, when I get back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To my home in Tennessee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>American doctors and American nurses, both by their
skill and care and tenderness, nursed that little fellow
back to complete recovery, made him remember everything
and shortly afterward, well and cured, he started
back, safe and sound, to his home in Tennessee.</p>

<p>Nothing I can ever say will overstate my estimation
of the credit that is deserved by our American doctors
and nurses for the great work they are doing. I am not
alone in knowing this. I call to witness any Canadian,
Englishman or Frenchman, that, if he is wounded, when
in the ambulance, he usually voices one request, "Take
me to an American hospital."</p>

<p>I knew of one man who entered that United States
Military Base Hospital near Paris, with one bullet
through the shoulder, another through an arm, an eye
shot out and a compound fracture of the skull, and those
American doctors and nurses by their attention and
skilfulness made it possible for him to step back into
boots and breeches and walk out of the hospital in ten
days.</p>

<p>It so happens that I am somewhat familiar with the
details in that case because I am the man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>"JULY 18TH"&mdash;THE TURN OF THE TIDE</h3>


<p>Through the steady growth of Marshal Foch's reserves,
by the speedy arrival of American forces, the
fourth German offensive of 1918, the personally directed
effort launched by the Crown Prince on May
27th, had been brought to a standstill.</p>

<p>The German thrust toward Paris had been stopped
by the Americans at Château-Thierry and in the Bois
de Belleau. It would be an injustice not to record the
great part played in that fighting by the French Army
attacked, but it would be equally unjust not to specify
as the French have gallantly done, that it was the timely
arrival of American strength that swung the balance
against the enemy. For the remainder of that month
of June and up to the middle of July, the fighting was
considered local in its character.</p>

<p>The German offensive had succeeded in pushing forward
the enemy front until it formed a loop extending
southward from the Aisne to the Valley of the Marne.
This salient was called the Château-Thierry pocket. The
line ran southward from a point east of Soissons to
Château-Thierry, where it touched the Marne, thence
eastward along both sides of the river to the vicinity of
Oeuilly where it recrossed the Marne and extended northward
to points beyond Rheims.</p>

<p>Château-Thierry was thus the peak of the German
push&mdash;the apex of the triangle pointing toward Paris.
The enemy supplied its forces in this peak principally
by the road that ran southward from Soissons and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
touched the Marne at Château-Thierry. To the west
of this road and just south of the city of Soissons, is
the forest of Villers-Cotterets. The enemy occupied the
northern and eastern limits of the forest and the remainder
of it was in the hands of the French.</p>

<p>This forest has always been considered one of the sentinels
of Paris. It was located on the right flank of
the German salient. It was a menace to that flank, and
offered a most attractive opportunity for an Allied counter
offensive from that direction. The Germans were
not unmindful of this.</p>

<p>The enemy knew that in the forest of Villers-Cotterets
it would be possible for Marshal Foch to mobilise
his much-feared reserves by taking advantage of the
natural screen provided by the forest. That Foch reserve
still remained a matter for enemy consideration
in spite of the fact that the successive German offensive
since March 21st had met with considerable success with
regard to the acquisition of territory. The Germans,
however, had been unable to ascertain whether Foch
had been forced to bring his reserves into the fight.</p>

<p>The situation demanded a full realisation by the enemy
of the possible use of this reserve at any time and they
knew that their lines in Villers-Cotterets Forest offered
an ever present invitation for the sudden application of
this reserve strength. Their lines at that point were
necessarily weak by the superiority of the Allied position
and, as a consequence, the Germans guarded this
weak spot by holding in reserve behind the line a number
of divisions of the Prussian Guard.</p>

<p>For the same reason, the enemy maintained constant
observation of the French position. Their planes would
fly over the forest every day taking photographs. They
sought to discover any evidences indicating that Foch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
might be preparing to strike a blow from that place.
They made careful note of the traffic along the roads
through the forest. They maintained a careful watch
to ascertain whether new ammunition dumps were being
concealed under the trees. Their observers tried to
ascertain whether any additional hospital arrangements
had been made by the French at that point. Any of
these things would have indicated that the French were
preparing to strike through the forest but the Germans
found nothing to support their suspicions.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they maintained their lines at maximum
strength. A belief existed among the German High
Command that an attack might be made on July 4th,
out of consideration to American sentiment. When the
attack did not develop on that day, they then thought
that the French might possibly spring the blow on July
14th, in celebration of their own national fête day. And
again they were disappointed in their surmises.</p>

<p>This protracted delay of an impending blow worried
the enemy. The Germans realised full well that
they were fighting against time. Their faith in the capacity
of their submarines to prevent American strength
from reaching the line, had been abandoned. They now
knew that every day that passed meant just that many
more American soldiers arriving in France, and the consequent
strengthening of the Allied forces during a season
when the Germans, through their repeated offensives,
were suffering terrible losses and were consequently
growing weaker.</p>

<p>So, on July 14th, when the Allied counter-offensive
had still failed to materialise, the German forces, by the
necessity for time, moved to a sudden and faulty decision.
They convinced themselves that they had overestimated
the Allied strength. They accepted the belief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
that the reason Foch had not attacked was because
he did not have sufficient strength to attack. With this,
then, as a basis for their plans, they immediately
launched another offensive, hoping that this might be
the one in which they could deliver the final blow.</p>

<p>This action began on Monday morning, July 15th,
and extended from Château-Thierry eastward along the
valley of the Maine, northward to Rheims and thence
eastward. By a remarkable coup, one small patrol of
French and Americans deprived the enemy of the element
of surprise in the attack. On the morning of the previous
day, this patrol successfully raided the enemy lines
to the east of Rheims and brought back prisoners from
whom it was learned that the Germans intended striking
on the following morning. The objectives of the
offensive were the French cities of Épernay and Châlons.
The accomplishment of this effort would have placed the
Rheims salient in the hands of the enemy and brought
the German lines southward to positions straddling the
Marne, down the valley of which they would thus be
able to launch another offensive on a straight road to
Paris.</p>

<p>The Germans needed considerable strength for this
new effort. To muster the shock divisions necessary for
the attack, they had to weaken their lines elsewhere.
The first reserves that they drew for this offensive were
the Prussian Guard divisions which they had been holding
in readiness in back of the weak spot in their line
in the Villers-Cotterets Forest. Those divisions were
hurriedly transported across the base of the V-shaped
salient and thrown into the attack to the east and the
southwest of Rheims.</p>

<p>The Germans found the Allied line prepared to receive
them. Their attacking waves were mowed down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
with terrific machine gun fire from French and American
gunners, while at the same time heavy artillery
barrages played upon the German back areas with deadly
effect in the massed ranks of the reserves. The fighting
was particularly vicious. It was destined to be the Germans'
last action of a grand offensive nature in the entire
war.</p>

<p>On the line east of Rheims, the German assault was
particularly strong in one sector where it encountered
the sturdy ranks of the Rainbow Division of United
States National Guardsmen, drawn from a dozen or more
different states in the Union. Regiments from Alabama
and New York held the front line. Iowa and Ohio were
close in support. In the support positions, sturdy
youngsters from Illinois, Indiana, and Minnesota
manned the American artillery.</p>

<p>The French general commanding the sector had not
considered it possible that this comparatively small
American force could withstand the first onslaught of
the Germans. He had made elaborate plans for a withdrawal
to high ground two or three miles southward,
from which he hoped to be able to resist the enemy to
greater advantage. But all day long, through the 15th
and the 16th and the 17th of July, those American lines
held, and the advancing waves of German storm troops
melted before our guns. Anticipating a renewal of the
attack on the next day, General Gouraud issued an order
on the evening of July 17th. It read:</p>

<p>
"<i>To the French and American Soldiers of the Army.</i><br />
</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p>"We may be attacked from one moment to another.
You all feel that a defensive battle was
never engaged in under more favourable conditions.
We are warned, and we are on our guard. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
have received strong reinforcements of infantry and
artillery. You will fight on ground, which, by your
assiduous labour, you have transformed into a formidable
fortress, into a fortress which is invincible
if the passages are well guarded.</p>

<p>"The bombardment will be terrible. You will
endure it without weakness. The attack in a cloud
of dust and gas will be fierce but your positions and
your armament are formidable.</p>

<p>"The strong and brave hearts of free men beat
in your breast. None will look behind, none will
give way. Every man will have but one thought&mdash;'Kill
them, kill them in abundance, until they
have had enough.' And therefore your General
tells you it will be a glorious day."</p></div>

<p>And so the line held, although the French General had
in preparation the plans for withdrawal. When, at the
end of the third day, the American line still occupied
the same position, the French General found that his
labour in preparing the plans for withdrawal had been
for nothing. He is reported to have thrown his hands
up in the air and remarked, "There doesn't seem to be
anything to do but to let the war be fought out where
the New York Irish and the Alabamans want to fight
it."</p>

<p>There was one humorous incident worthy of record in
that fighting. Great rivalry existed between the New
York regiment and the Alabama regiment, both of which
happened to be units of the same brigade. Both the
New Yorkers and the Alabamans had a mutual hatred
for the German but, in addition to that, each of them
was possessed with a mutual dislike for the other. There
had been frequent clashes of a more or less sportsmanlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
and fistic nature between men from both of the regiments.</p>

<p>On the second day of the fighting, the Germans had
sent over low-flying airplanes which skimmed the tops
of our trenches and sprayed them with machine gun
fire. A man from Alabama, who had grown up from
childhood with a squirrel rifle under his arm, accomplished
something that had never been done before in the
war. From his position in a trench, he took careful
aim with his rifle and brought down one of the German
planes. It was the first time in the history of the Western
Front that a rifleman on the ground had done this.</p>

<p>When the colonel of the New York regiment heard
this, he was wild with envy and let it be known that
there would be trouble brewing unless his regiment at
least equalled the feat. So, on the following day, an
Irishman in the ranks stood up and brought one German
plane down to the credit of the old Sixty-ninth.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>To the southwest of Rheims, Germans, who succeeded
in breaking through the lines at one place on the south
banks of the Marne, encountered American reinforcements
and were annihilated to the number of five thousand.
At no place did the enemy meet with the success
desired.</p>

<p>The Germans had launched their attack at six o'clock
on the morning of July 15th. At Vaux their demonstration
was considered a feint, but along the Marne to
the east of Château-Thierry, between Fossy and Mezy,
the assaulting waves advanced with fury and determination.
At one place, twenty-five thousand of the enemy
crossed the river, and the small American forces in front
of them at that place were forced to retire on Conde-en-Bire.
In a counter attack, we succeeded in driving fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
thousand of them back to the north bank, the remaining
ten thousand representing casualties with the
exception of fifteen hundred, who were captured.</p>

<p>Further eastward, the Germans established bridgehead
positions on the south bank of the river at Dormas.
The enemy enjoyed a minor success in an attack on the
line near Bligny to the southwest of Rheims, where Italian
troops fought with remarkable valour. Everywhere
else the lines held solid and upon the close of that first
night, Marshal Foch said, "I am satisfied&mdash;<i>Je suis content</i>."</p>

<p>At dawn the following day, the enemy's futile efforts
were resumed along the river east of Château-Thierry.
The Germans suffered appalling losses in their efforts to
place pontoon bridges at Gland and at Mareuil-le-Port.
St. Agnan and La Chapelle Monthodon fell into the
hands of Americans on the same day.</p>

<p>On the 17th, the enemy's endeavours to reach Festigny
on both banks of the river came to naught, but to the
southeast of Rheims, his assaulting waves reached the
northern limits of Montagne Forest. The Germans were
trying to pinch out the Rheims salient. This was the
condition of the opposing lines on the night of July 17th,&mdash;the
night that preceded the day on which the tide of
victory turned for the Allies.</p>

<p>Foch was now ready to strike. The Allied Commander-in-Chief
had decided to deliver his blow on the
right flank of the German salient. The line chosen for
the Allied assault was located between a point south of
Soissons and Château-Thierry. It represented a front
of some twenty-five miles extending southward from the
valley of the Aisne to the Marne. Villers-Cotterets
Forest was the key position for the Allies.</p>

<p>It was from out that forest that the full strength of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
the blow was to be delivered. To make the blow effective
at that most vital point, Marshal Foch needed a
strong and dependable assaulting force. He needed
three divisions of the hardest fighting soldiers that he
could get. He had a considerable army to select from.
As Commander-in-Chief of all the Allied armies, he was
in command of all of the British army, all of the French
army, all of the American army, the Italian, the Belgian,&mdash;all
of the military forces of the Allied nations of
the world. Marshal Foch's command numbered eleven
million bayonets.</p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief had all of these veteran
fighting men from which he could select the three divisions
necessary to deliver this blow upon which the civilisation
of the world depended.</p>

<p>The first division he chose was the Foreign Legion
of the French army. In four years of bloody fighting,
the Foreign Legion, composed of soldiers of fortune
from every country in the world, had never been absent
in an attack. It had lived up thoroughly to its reputation
as the most fearless unit of shock troops in the
French army.</p>

<p>And then for the other two divisions that were needed,
Marshal Foch selected, from all the eleven million men
under his command, the First and the Second Regular
United States Army Divisions. The Second Division
included the immortal Brigade of United States Marines,
that had covered themselves with glory in the
Bois de Belleau.</p>

<p>It was a great distinction for those two American divisions
to have thus been selected to play such a vital
part in the entire war. It was an honour that every
officer and man in both divisions felt keenly.</p>

<p>I have in my map case a torn and much folded little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
piece of paper. I received it that night of July 17th in
Villers-Cotterets Forest. A similar piece of paper was
received by every officer in those two American divisions.
To me this piece of paper represents the order
which resulted in victory for the Allied world. It reads:</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p><i>Headquarters Third Army Corps American Expeditionary Forces</i>,</p>

<p class='quotdate'>
<i>France, July 17, 1918</i></p>
<p>
<i>Memorandum</i>:<br />
</p>

<p>The Third Corps of the American Expeditionary
Forces has been created and consists of the 1st. and 2nd.
Divisions, two divisions that are known throughout
France.</p>

<p>Officers and men of the Third Corps, you have been
deemed worthy to be placed beside the best veteran
French troops. See that you prove worthy. Remember
that in what is now coming you represent the whole
American nation.</p>

<p class='quotdate'>
<span class="smcap">R. L. Bullard</span>,<br />

Commanding 3rd. Corps.<br />
</p></div>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>The German planes flying high over Villers-Cotterets
Forest all day during the 17th, had seen nothing.
The appearance of all the myriad roads that cross and
recross the forest in all directions was normal. But that
night things began to happen in the forest.</p>

<p>For once at least, the elements were favourable to
our cause. There was no moon. The night was very
dark and under the trees the blackness seemed impenetrable.
A heavy downpour of rain began and although
it turned most of the roads into mud, the leafy roof of
the forest held much of the moisture and offered some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
protection to the thousands of men who spent the night
beneath it. Thunder rolled as I had never heard it roll
in France before. The sound drowned the occasional
boom of distant cannon. At intervals, terrific crashes
would be followed by blinding flashes of lightning as
nature's bolts cut jagged crevices in the sombre sky and
vented their fury upon some splintered giant of the forest.</p>

<p>The immediate front was silent&mdash;comparatively silent
if one considered the din of the belligerent elements.
In the opposing front lines in the northern and
eastern limits of the forest, German and Frenchmen
alike huddled in their rude shelters to escape the rain.</p>

<p>Then, along every road leading through the forest to
the north and to the east, streams of traffic began to
pour. All of it was moving forward toward the front.
No traffic bound for the rear was permitted. Every
inch of available road space was vitally necessary for
the forces in movement. The roads that usually accommodated
one line of vehicles moving forward and
one line moving to the rear, now represented two streams&mdash;solid
streams&mdash;moving forward. In those streams
were gun carriages, caissons, limbers, ammunition carts
and grunting tractors hauling large field pieces.</p>

<p>In the gutters on either side of the road, long lines of
American infantry plodded forward through the mud
and darkness. In the occasional flash of a light, I could
see that they were equipped for heavy fighting. Many
of them had their coats off, their sleeves rolled up, while
beads of sweat stood out on the young faces that shown
eager beneath the helmets. On their backs they carried,
in addition to their cumbersome packs, extra shoes and
extra bandoliers of cartridges.</p>

<p>From their shoulders were suspended gas masks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
haversacks. Their waists were girded with loaded ammunition
belts, with bayonet hanging at the left side.
Some of them wore grenade aprons full of explosives.
Nearly all of them carried their rifles or machine gun
parts slung across their backs as they leaned forward under
their burdens and plunged wearily on into the mud
and darkness, the thunder and lightning, the world destiny
that was before them. Their lines were interspersed
with long files of plodding mules dragging small, two-wheeled,
narrow gauge carts loaded down with machine
gun ammunition.</p>

<p>Under the trees to either side of the road, there was
more movement. American engineers struggled forward
through the underbrush carrying, in addition to
their rifles and belts, rolls of barbed wire, steel posts,
picks and shovels and axes and saws. Beside them
marched the swarthy, undersized, bearded veterans of
the Foreign Legion. Further still under the trees,
French cavalry, with their lances slung slantwise across
their shoulders, rode their horses in and out between the
giant trunks.</p>

<p>At road intersections, I saw mighty metal monsters
with steel plated sides splotched with green and brown
and red paint. These were the French tanks that were
to take part in the attack. They groaned and grunted
on their grinding gears as they man&oelig;uvred about for
safer progress. In front of each tank there walked a
man who bore suspended from his shoulders on his back,
a white towel so that the unseen directing genius in the
tank's turret could steer his way through the underbrush
and crackling saplings that were crushed down
under the tread of this modern Juggernaut.</p>

<p>There was no confusion, no outward manifestations
of excitement. There was no rattle of musketry, shouting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
of commands or waving of swords. Officers addressed
their men in whispers. There was order and
quiet save for the roll of thunder and the eternal dripping
of water from the wet leaves, punctuated now and
then by the ear-splitting crashes that followed each
nearby flash of lightning.</p>

<p>Through it all, everything moved. It was a mighty
mobilisation in the dark. Everything was moving in one
direction&mdash;forward&mdash;all with the same goal, all with the
same urging, all with the same determination, all with
the same hope. The forest was ghostly with their
forms. It seemed to me that night in the damp darkness
of Villers-Cotterets Forest that every tree gave birth to
a man for France.</p>

<p>All night long the gathering of that sinister synod continued.
All night long those furtive forces moved
through the forest. They passed by every road, by
every lane, through every avenue of trees. I heard the
whispered commands of the officers. I heard the sloshing
of the mud under foot and the occasional muffled
curse of some weary marcher who would slip to the
ground under the weight of his burden; and I knew, all
of us knew, that at the zero hour, 4:35 o'clock in the
morning, all hell would land on the German line, and
these men from the trees would move forward with the
fate of the world in their hands.</p>

<p>There was some suspense. We knew that if the Germans
had had the slightest advance knowledge about that
mobilisation of Foch's reserves that night, they would
have responded with a downpour of gas shells, which
spreading their poisonous fumes under the wet roof of
the forest, might have spelt slaughter for 70,000 men.</p>

<p>But the enemy never knew. They never even suspected.
And at the tick of 4:35 A.M., the heavens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
seemed to crash asunder, as tons and tons of hot metal
sailed over the forest, bound for the German line.</p>

<p>That mighty artillery eruption came from a concentration
of all the guns of all calibres of all the Allies that
Foch could muster. It was a withering blast and where
it landed in that edge of the forest occupied by the Germans,
the quiet of the dripping black night was suddenly
turned into a roaring inferno of death.</p>

<p>Giant tree trunks were blown high into the air and
splintered into match-wood. Heavy projectiles bearing
delayed action fuses, penetrated the ground to great
depth before exploding and then, with the expansion of
their powerful gases, crushed the enemy dugouts as if
they were egg shells.</p>

<p>Then young America&mdash;your sons and your brothers
and your husbands, shoulder to shoulder with the French&mdash;went
over the top to victory.</p>

<p>The preliminary barrage moved forward crashing the
forest down about it. Behind it went the tanks ambling
awkwardly but irresistibly over all obstructions. Those
Germans that had not been killed in the first terrific blast,
came up out of their holes only to face French and
American bayonets, and the "Kamerad" chorus began
at once.</p>

<p>Our assaulting waves moved forward, never hesitating,
never faltering. Ahead of them were the tanks giving
special attention to enemy machine gun nests that
manifested stubbornness. We did not have to charge
those death-dealing nests that morning as we did in the
Bois de Belleau. The tanks were there to take care of
them. One of these would move toward a nest, flirt
around it several minutes and then politely sit on it. It
would never be heard from thereafter.</p>

<p>It was an American whirlwind of fighting fury that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
swept the Germans in front of it early that morning.
Aeroplanes had been assigned to hover over the advance
and make reports on all progress. A dense mist hanging
over the forest made it impossible for the aviators to
locate the Divisional Headquarters to which they were
supposed to make the reports. These dense clouds of
vapour obscured the earth from the eyes of the airmen,
but with the rising sun the mists lifted.</p>

<p>Being but a month out of the hospital and having
spent a rather strenuous night, I was receiving medical
attention at daybreak in front of a dressing station not
far from the headquarters of Major General Harbord
commanding the Second Division. As I lay there looking
up through the trees, I saw a dark speck diving from
the sky. Almost immediately I could hear the hum of
its motors growing momentarily louder as it neared the
earth. I thought the plane was out of control and expected
to see it crash to the ground near me.</p>

<p>Several hundred feet above the tree tops, it flattened
its wings and went into an easy swoop so that its under-gear
seemed barely to skim the uppermost branches.
The machine pursued a course immediately above one
of the roads. Something dropped from it. It was a
metal cylinder that glistened in the rays of the morning
sun. Attached to it was a long streamer of fluttering
white material. It dropped easily to the ground nearby.
I saw an American signalman, who had been following
its descent, pick it up. He opened the metal container
and extracted the message containing the first aerial observations
of the advance of the American lines. It
stated that large numbers of prisoners had been captured
and were bound for the rear.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of this information, Division Headquarters
moved forward on the jump. Long before noon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
General Harbord, close behind his advancing troops,
opened headquarters in the shattered farm buildings of
Verte Feuille, the first community centre that had been
taken by our men that morning. Prisoners were coming
back in droves.</p>

<p>I encountered one column of disarmed Germans
marching four abreast with the typical attitude of a
"Kamerad" procession. The first eight of the prisoners
carried on their shoulders two rudely constructed litters
made from logs and blankets. A wounded American
was on one litter and a wounded Frenchman on the
other.</p>

<p>A number of German knapsacks had been used to elevate
the shoulders of both of the wounded men so that
they occupied positions half sitting and half reclining.
Both of them were smoking cigarettes and chatting gaily
as they rode high and mighty on the shoulders of their
captives, while behind them stretched a regal retinue of
eight hundred more.</p>

<p>As this column proceeded along one side of the road,
the rest of the roadway was filled with men, guns and
equipment all moving forward. Scottish troops in kilts
swung by and returned the taunts which our men laughingly
directed at their kilts and bare knees.</p>

<p>Slightly wounded Americans came back guarding convoys
of prisoners. They returned loaded with relics of
the fighting. It was said that day that German prisoners
had explained that in their opinion, the British were
in the war because they hated Germany and that the
French were in the war because the war was in France,
but that Americans seemed to be fighting to collect souveniers.</p>

<p>I saw one of these American souvenier collectors
bound for the rear. In stature he was one of the shortest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
men I had ever seen in our uniform. He must have
spent long years in the cavalry, because he was frightfully
bowlegged. He was herding in front of him two
enormous German prisoners who towered head and
shoulders above him.</p>

<p>He manifested a confidence in his knowledge of all
prisoners and things German. Germans were "foreigners."
"Foreigners" spoke a foreign language. Therefore
to make a German understand you, it was only necessary
to speak with them in a foreign language. French
was a foreign language so the bowlegged American
guard made use of his limited knowledge.</p>

<p>"Allay! Allay! Allay veet t'ell outer here," he urged
his charges.</p>

<p>He was wearing his helmet back on his head so that
there was exposed a shock of black, blood-matted hair
on his forehead. A white bandage ran around his forehead
and on the right side of his face a strip of cotton
gauze connected with another white bandage around his
neck. There was a red stain on the white gauze over the
right cheek.</p>

<p>His face was rinsed with sweat and very dirty. In
one hand he carried a large chunk of the black German
war bread&mdash;once the property of his two prisoners.
With his disengaged hand he conveyed masses of the
food to his lips which were circled with a fresco of
crumbs.</p>

<p>His face was wreathed in a remarkable smile&mdash;a smile
of satisfaction that caused the corners of his mouth to
turn upward toward his eyes. I also smiled when I
made a casual inventory of the battlefield loot with which
he had decorated his person. Dangling by straps from
his right hip were five holsters containing as many German
automatic pistols of the Lueger make, worth about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
$35 apiece. Suspended from his right shoulder by straps
to his left hip, were six pairs of highly prized German
field glasses, worth about $100 apiece. I acquired a better
understanding of his contagious smile of property
possession when I inquired his name and his rank. He
replied:</p>

<p>"Sergeant Harry Silverstein."</p>

<p>Later, attracted by a blast of extraordinary profanity,
I approached one of our men who was seated by the
roadside. A bullet had left a red crease across his
cheek but this was not what had stopped him. The hobnail
sole of his shoe had been torn off and he was trying
to fasten it back on with a combination of straps.
His profane denunciations included the U. S. Quartermaster
Department, French roads, barbed wire, hot
weather and, occasionally, the Germans.</p>

<p>"This sure is a hell of a mess," he said, "for a fellow
to find himself in this fix just when I was beginning
to catch sight of 'em. I enlisted in the army to come to
France to kill Germans but I never thought for one minute
they'd bring me over here and try to make me run
'em to death. What we need is greyhounds. And as
usual the Q. M. fell down again. Why, there wasn't a
lassoe in our whole company."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The prisoners came back so fast that the Intelligence
Department was flooded. The divisional intelligence officer
asked me to assist in the interrogation of the captives.
I questioned some three hundred of them.</p>

<p>An American sergeant who spoke excellent German,
interrogated. I sat behind a small table in a field and
the sergeant would call the prisoners forward one by one.
In German he asked one captive what branch of the service
he belonged to. The prisoner wishing to display his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
knowledge of English and at the same time give vent to
some pride, replied in English.</p>

<p>"I am of the storm troop," he said.</p>

<p>"Storm troop?" replied the American sergeant, "do
you know what we are? We are from Kansas. We
are Cycloners."</p>

<p>Another German student of English among the prisoners
was represented in the person of a pompous German
major, who, in spite of being a captive, maintained
all the dignity of his rank. He stood proudly erect and
held his head high. He wore a disgusted look on his
face, as though the surroundings were painful. His
uniform was well pressed, his linen was clean, his boots
were well polished, he was clean shaven. There was
not a speck of dust upon him and he did not look like a
man who had gone through the hell of battle that morning.
The American sergeant asked him in German to
place the contents of his pockets on the table.</p>

<p>"I understand English," he replied superciliously, with
a strong accent, as he complied with the request. I noticed,
however, that he neglected to divest himself of one
certain thing that caught my interest. It was a leather
thong that extended around his neck and disappeared between
the first and second buttons of his tunic. Curiosity
forced me to reach across the table and extract the
hidden terminal of that thong. I found suspended on
it the one thing in all the world that exactly fitted me
and that I wanted. It was a one-eyed field glass. I
thanked him.</p>

<p>He told me that he had once been an interne in a hospital
in New York but happening to be in Germany at
the outbreak of the war, he had immediately entered the
army and had risen to the rank of a major in the Medical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
Corps. I was anxious for his opinion, obvious as it
might have seemed.</p>

<p>"What do you think of the fighting capacity of the
American soldier?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"I do not know," he replied in the accented but dignified
tones of a superior who painfully finds himself in
the hands of one considered inferior. "I have never
seen him fight. He is persuasive&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>"I was in a dugout with forty German wounded in
the cellar under the Beaurepaire Farm, when the terrible
bombardment landed. I presume my gallant comrades
defending the position died at their posts, because
soon the barrage lifted and I walked across the cellar
to the bottom of the stairs and looked up.</p>

<p>"There in the little patch of white light on the level
of the ground above me, I saw the first American soldier
I have seen in the war. But he did not impress me
much as a soldier. I did not like his carriage or his
bearing.</p>

<p>"He wore his helmet far back on his head. And he
did not have his coat on. His collar was not buttoned;
it was rolled back and his throat was bare. His sleeves
were rolled up to the elbow. And he had a grenade in
each hand.</p>

<p>"Just then he looked down the stairs and saw me&mdash;saw
me standing there&mdash;saw me, a major&mdash;and he
shouted roughly, 'Come out of there, you big Dutch
B&mdash;&mdash;d, or I'll spill a basketful of these on you.'"</p>

<p>All through that glorious day of the 18th, our lines
swept forward victoriously. The First Division fought
it out on the left, the Foreign Legion in the centre and
the Second Division with the Marines pushed forward
on the right. Village after village fell into our hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
We captured batteries of guns and thousands of prisoners.</p>

<p>On through the night the Allied assault continued.
Our men fought without water or food. All road space
behind the lines was devoted to the forwarding of reserves,
artillery and munitions. By the morning of the
19th, we had so far penetrated the enemy's lines that
we had crossed the road running southward from Soissons
to Château-Thierry, thereby disrupting the enemy's
communications between his newly established base
and the peak of his salient. Thus exposed to an enveloping
movement that might have surrounded large numbers,
there was nothing left for the Germans to do but
to withdraw.</p>

<p>The Allied army commander, who directed the Americans
on that glorious day, was General Joseph Mangin.
His opinion of the immortal part played on that
day by those two American divisions may be seen in the
following order which he caused to be published:</p>

<p><i>Officers, Noncommissioned Officers, and Soldiers of the
American Army</i>:</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Shoulder to shoulder with your French comrades, you
threw yourselves into the counter-offensive begun on
July 18th. You ran to it as if going to a feast. Your
magnificent dash upset and surprised the enemy, and
your indomitable tenacity stopped counter attacks by his
fresh divisions. You have shown yourselves to be
worthy sons of your great country and have gained the
admiration of your brothers in arms.</p>

<p>Ninety-one cannon, 7,200 prisoners, immense booty,
and ten kilometres of reconquered territory are your
share of the trophies of this victory. Besides this, you
have acquired a feeling of your superiority over the barbarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
enemy against whom the children of liberty are
fighting. To attack him is to vanquish him.</p>

<p>American comrades, I am grateful to you for the
blood you generously spilled on the soil of my country.
I am proud of having commanded you during such
splendid days and to have fought with you for the deliverance
of the world.</p></div>

<p>The Germans began backing off the Marne. From
that day on, their movement to date has continued backward.
It began July 18th. Two American Divisions
played glorious parts in the crisis. It was their day. It
was America's day. It was the turn of the tide.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>THE DAWN OF VICTORY</h3>


<p>The waited hour had come. The forced retreat of
the German hordes had begun. Hard on their heels, the
American lines started their northward push, backing
the Boche off the Marne.</p>

<p>On the morning of July 21st I rode into Château-Thierry
with the first American soldiers to enter
the town. The Germans had evacuated hurriedly.
Château-Thierry was reoccupied jointly by our forces
and those of the French.</p>

<p>Here was the grave of German hopes. Insolent, imperialistic
longings for the great prize, Paris, ended
here. The dream of the Kultur conquest of the world
had become a nightmare of horrible realisation that
America was in the war. Pompously flaunted strategy
crumpled at historic Château-Thierry.</p>

<p>That day of the occupation, the wrecked city was comparatively
quiet. Only an occasional German shell&mdash;a
final parting spite shell&mdash;whined disconsolately overhead
and landed in a cloud of dust and débris in some vacant
ruin that had once been a home.</p>

<p>For seven long weeks the enemy had been in occupation
of that part of the city on the north bank of the
river. Now the streets were littered with débris. Although
the walls of most of the buildings seemed to be
in good shape, the scene was one of utter devastation.</p>

<p>The Germans had built barricades across the streets&mdash;particularly
the streets that led down to the river&mdash;because
it was those streets that were swept with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
terrific fire of American machine guns. At the intersections
of those streets the Germans under cover of
night had taken up the cobblestones and built parapets
to protect them from the hail of lead.</p>

<p>Wrecked furniture was hip deep on the Rue Carnot.
Along the north bank of the river on the Quai de la
Poterne and the Promenade de la Levée, the invader had
left his characteristic mark. Shop after shop had been
looted of its contents and the fronts of the pretty sidewalk
cafés along this business thoroughfare had been
reduced to shells of their former selves.</p>

<p>Not a single living being was in sight as we marched
in. Some of the old townsfolk and some young children
had remained but they were still under cover.
Among these French people who had lived for seven
weeks through the hell of battle that had raged about
the town, was Madame de Prey, who was eighty-seven
years old. To her, home meant more than life. She
had spent the time in her cellar, caring for German
wounded.</p>

<p>The town had been systematically pillaged. The German
soldiers had looted from the shops much material
which they had made up into packages to be mailed back
to home folks in the Fatherland. The church, strangely
enough, was picked out as a depository for their larcenies.
Nothing from the robes of the priests down to
the copper faucet of a water pipe had escaped their
greed.</p>

<p>The advancing Americans did not linger in the town&mdash;save
for small squads of engineers that busied themselves
with the removal of the street obstructions and
the supply organisations that perfected communication
for the advancing lines. These Americans were Yankees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
all&mdash;they comprised the 26th U. S. Division, representing
the National Guard of New England.</p>

<p>Our lines kept pushing to the north. The Germans
continued their withdrawal and the Allied necessity was
to keep contact with them. This, the Yankee Division
succeeded in doing. The first obstacle encountered to
the north of Château-Thierry was the stand that the
Germans made at the town of Epieds.</p>

<p>On July 23rd, our infantry had proceeded up a ravine
that paralleled the road into Epieds. German machine
guns placed on the hills about the village, swept them
with a terrible fire. Our men succeeded in reaching the
village, but the Germans responded with such a terrific
downpour of shell that our weakened ranks were forced
to withdraw and the Germans re-entered the town.</p>

<p>On the following day we renewed the attack with the
advantage of positions which we had won during the
night in the Bois de Trugny and the Bois de Châtelet.
We advanced from three sides and forced the Germans
to evacuate. Trugny, the small village on the edge of
the woods, was the scene of more bloody fighting which
resulted in our favour.</p>

<p>Further north of Epieds, the Germans having entrenched
themselves along the roadway, had fortified
the same with a number of machine guns which commanded
the flat terrain in such a way as to make a
frontal attack by infantry waves most costly. The security
of the Germans in this position received a severe
shock when ten light automobiles, each one mounting one
or two machine guns, started up the road toward the
enemy, firing as they sped. It was something new. The
Germans wanted to surrender, but the speed of the cars
obviated such a possibility. So the enemy fled before
our gasoline cavalry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>The Germans were withdrawing across the river
Ourcq, whose valley is parallel to that of the Marne and
just to the north. The enemy's intentions of making a
stand here were frustrated by violent attacks, which succeeded
in carrying our forces into positions on the north
side of the Ourcq. These engagements straightened out
the Allied line from the Ourcq on the west to Fère-en-Tardenois
on the east, which had been taken the same
day by French and American troops.</p>

<p>By this time the German withdrawal was becoming
speedier. Such strong pressure was maintained by our
men against the enemy's rear guards that hundreds of
tons of German ammunition had to be abandoned and
fell into our hands. Still the retreat bore no evidences
of a rout.</p>

<p>The enemy retired in orderly fashion. He bitterly
contested every foot of ground he was forced to give.
The American troops engaged in those actions had to
fight hard for every advance. The German backed out
of the Marne salient as a Western "bad man" would
back out of a saloon with an automatic pistol in each
hand.</p>

<p>Those charges that our men made across the muddy
flats of the Ourcq deserve a place in the martial history
of America. They faced a veritable hell of machine
gun fire. They went through barrages of shrapnel and
high explosive shell. They invaded small forests that
the enemy had flooded with poison gas. No specific objectives
were assigned. The principal order was "Up
and at 'em" and this was reinforced by every man's determination
to keep the enemy on the run now that they
had been started.</p>

<p>Even the enemy's advantage of high positions north
of the river failed to hold back the men from New York,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
from Iowa, Alabama, Ohio, Illinois, Minnesota and
Indiana, who had relieved the hard fighting Yankees.
These new American organisations went up against fresh
German divisions that had been left behind with orders
to hold at all cost. But nothing the enemy could do
could prevent our crossing of the Ourcq.</p>

<p>On July 30th the fighting had become most intense
in character. The fact that the town of Sergy was
captured, lost and recaptured nine times within twenty-four
hours, is some criterion of the bitterness of the
struggle. This performance of our men can be better
understood when it is stated that the enemy opposing
them there consisted of two fresh divisions of the
Kaiser's finest&mdash;his Prussian Guard.</p>

<p>After that engagement with our forces, the Fourth
Prussian Guard Division went into an enforced retirement.
When our men captured Sergy the last time, they
did so in sufficient strength to withhold it against repeated
fierce counter attacks by a Bavarian Guard division
that had replaced the wearied Prussians.</p>

<p>But before the crack Guard Division was withdrawn
from the line, it had suffered terrible losses at our hands.
Several prisoners captured said that their company had
gone into the fight one hundred and fifty strong and only
seven had survived. That seven were captured by our
men in hand to hand fighting.</p>

<p>While our engineer forces repaired the roads and
constructed bridges in the wake of our advancing lines,
the enemy brought to that part of the front new squadrons
of air fighters which were sent over our lines for
the purpose of observation and interference with communications.
They continually bombed our supply depots
and ammunition dumps.</p>

<p>After the crossing of the Ourcq the American advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
reached the next German line of resistance, which rested
on two terminal strongholds. One was in the Forêt de
Nesles and the other was in the Bois de Meunière.</p>

<p>The fighting about these two strong points was particularly
fierce. In the Bois de Meunière and around the
town of Cièrges, the German resistance was most determined.
About three hundred Jaegers held Hill 200,
which was located in the centre of Cièrges Forest, just
to the south of the village of the same name. They
were well provided with machine guns and ammunition.
They were under explicit orders to hold and they did.</p>

<p>Our men finally captured the position at the point of
the bayonet. Most of its defenders fought to the death.
The capture of the hill was the signal for a renewal
of our attacks against the seemingly impregnable
Meunière woods. Six times our advancing waves
reached the German positions in the southern edge of
the woods and six times we were driven back.</p>

<p>There were some American Indians in the ranks of
our units attacking there&mdash;there were lumber jacks and
farmer boys and bookkeepers, and they made heroic
rushes against terrific barriers of hidden machine guns.
But after a day of gallant fighting they had been unable
to progress.</p>

<p>Our efforts had by no means been exhausted. The
following night our artillery concentrated on the
southern end of the woods and literally turned it into an
inferno with high explosive shells. Early in the morning
we moved to the attack again. Two of the Kaiser's
most reputable divisions, the 200th Jaegers and the 216th
Reserve, occupied the wood. The fighting in the wood
was fierce and bloody, but it was more to the liking of
our men than the rushes across fire-swept fields. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
men went to work with the bayonet. And for six hours
they literally carved their way through four kilometres
of the forest. Before ten o'clock the next morning, our
lines lay to the north of the woods.</p>

<p>In consolidating the gains in the woods, our men surrounded
in a small clearing some three hundred of the
enemy who refused to surrender. American squads advanced
with the bayonet from all sides. The Germans
were fighting for their lives. Only three remained to
accept the ignominy of capture.</p>

<p>Our forward progress continued and by August 4th
the Germans were withdrawing across the Vesle River.
The immediate objective that presented itself to the
Americans was the important German supply depot at
Fismes. It was in and around Fismes that some of the
bloodiest fighting in the second battle of the Marne took
place. The capture of Fismes was the crowning achievement
of one American division that so distinguished itself
as to be made the subject of a special report to the
French General Headquarters by the French army in
which the Americans fought. In part, the report read:</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p>"On Aug. 4th the infantry combats were localized with
terrible fury. The outskirts of Fismes were solidly
held by the Germans, where their advance groups were
difficult to take. The Americans stormed them and
reduced them with light mortars and thirty-sevens.
They succeeded, though not without loss, and at the
end of the day, thanks to this slow but sure tenacity,
they were within one kilometre of Fismes and masters
of Villes, Savoye and Chezelle Farm. All night long
rains hindered their movements and rendered their following
day's task more arduous. On their right the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
French had, by similar stages, conquered a series of
woods and swamps of Meunière Woods, to the east of
St. Gilles, and were on the plateau of Bonne Maison
Farm. To the left another American unit had been able
to advance upon the Vesle to the east of St. Thiébault.</p>

<p>"On Aug. 5th the artillery prepared for the attack
on Fismes by a bombardment, well regulated, and the
final assault was launched. The Americans penetrated
into the village and then began the mean task of clearing
the last point of resistance. That evening this task was
almost completed. We held all the northern part of the
village as far as Rheims road, and patrols were sent into
the northern end of the village. Some even succeeded
in crossing the Vesle, but were satisfied with making a
reconnaissance, as the Germans still occupied the right
bank of the river in great strength. All that was left
to be accomplished was to complete the mopping up of
Fismes and the strengthening of our positions to withstand
an enemy counter attack.</p>

<p>"Such was the advance of one American division,
which pushed the enemy forward from Roncheres on
July 30th a distance of eighteen kilometres and crowned
its successful advance with the capture of Fismes on
Aug. 5th."</p></div>

<p>The German line on the Vesle river fell shortly after
the capture of Fismes. The enemy was forced to fall
back to his next natural line of defence on the Aisne.
Between the Vesle and the Aisne, the Americans assisted
the French in the application of such persistent
pressure that the enemy's stubborn resistance was overcome
and in many places he was forced to withdraw
before he had time to destroy his depots of supply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<p>On August 9th, General Degoutte, commanding the
Sixth French Army, issued the following order:</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p>"Before the great offensive of July 18th, the American
troops, forming part of the 6th French Army, distinguished
themselves by clearing the 'Brigade de Marine'
Woods and the village of Vaux of the enemy and arresting
his offensive on the Marne and at Fossoy.</p>

<p>"Since then they have taken the most glorious part in
the second battle of the Marne, rivalling the French
troops in ardour and valour.</p>

<p>"During twenty days of constant fighting they have
freed numerous French villages and made, across a difficult
country, an advance of forty kilometres, which has
brought them to the Vesle.</p>

<p>"Their glorious marches are marked by names which
will shine in future in the military history of the United
States: Torcy, Belleau, Plateau d'Etrepilly, Epieds, Le
Charmel, l'Ourcq, Seringeset Nesles, Sergy, La Vesle
and Fismes.</p>

<p>"These young divisions, who saw fire for the first
time, have shown themselves worthy of the old war
traditions of the regular army. They have had the same
burning desire to fight the Boche, the same discipline
which sees that the order given by their commander is
always executed, whatever the difficulties to be overcome
and the sacrifices to be suffered.</p>

<p>"The magnificent results obtained are due to the energy
and the skill of the commanders, to the bravery of the
soldiers.</p>

<p>"I am proud to have commanded such troops."</p></div>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>Through the month of August and up to the first days
of September, the Americans participated in the important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
operations to the north of Soissons, where on
August 29th they played a big part in the capture of
the Juvigny Plateau.</p>

<p>In this fighting, which was marked by the desperate
resistance of the enemy, the Americans were incorporated
in the 10th French Army under the command of General
Mangin. Violent counter attacks by German shock divisions
failed to stem the persistent advances of our forces.</p>

<p>A large hill to the north of Juvigny constituted a key
and supporting position for the enemy. In spite of the
large number of machine guns concealed on its slopes,
the Americans succeeded in establishing a line between
the hill and the town. At the same time the American
line extended itself around the other side of the hill.
With the consummation of this enveloping movement,
the hill was taken by assault.</p>

<p>On Labor Day, September 2nd, after bitterly engaging
four German divisions for five days, the Americans
advanced their lines to Terny-Sorny and the road running
between Soissons and St. Quentin. This achievement,
which was accomplished by driving the Germans
back a depth of four miles on a two mile front, gave our
forces a good position on the important plateau running
to the north of the Aisne.</p>

<p>Our observation stations now commanded a view
across the valley toward the famous Chemin des Dames
which at one time had been a part of the Hindenburg
line. Before the invasion of the German hordes, France
possessed no fairer countryside than the valley of the
Aisne. But the Germans, retreating, left behind them
only wreckage and ashes and ruin. The valley spread
out before our lines was scarred with the shattered remains
of what had once been peaceful farming communities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
To the northwest there could be seen the
spires above the city of Laon.</p>

<p>The American units which took part in this bitter
fighting that had continued without a day's cessation
since July 18th, were mentioned specifically in an order
issued on August 27th by General Pershing. The order
read:</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p>"It fills me with pride to record in general orders a
tribute to the service achievements of the First and Third
Corps, comprising the First, Second, Third, Fourth,
Twenty-sixth, Twenty-eighth, Thirty-second and Forty-second
Divisions of the American Expeditionary Forces.</p>

<p>"You came to the battlefield at a crucial hour for
the Allied cause. For almost four years the most formidable
army the world has yet seen had pressed its
invasion of France and stood threatening its capital.
At no time has that army been more powerful and
menacing than when, on July 15th, it struck again to
destroy in one great battle the brave men opposed to it
and to enforce its brutal will upon the world and civilisation.</p>

<p>"Three days later in conjunction with our Allies you
counter-attacked. The Allied armies gained a brilliant
victory that marks the turning point of the war. You
did more than to give the Allies the support to which,
as a nation, our faith was pledged. You proved that
our altruism, our pacific spirit, and our sense of justice
have not blunted our virility or our courage.</p>

<p>"You have shown that American initiative and energy
are as fit for the tasks of war as for the pursuits of
peace. You have justly won unstinted praise from our
Allies and the eternal gratitude of our countrymen.</p>

<p>"We have paid for our successes with the lives of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
many of our brave comrades. We shall cherish their
memory always and claim for our history and literature
their bravery, achievement and sacrifice.</p>

<p>"This order will be read to all organisations at the
first assembly formations following its receipt.</p>

<p class='quotdate'>
"<span class="smcap">Pershing</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>August 10th marked a milestone in the military effort
of the United States. On that day the organisation
was completed of the First American Field Army. I
have tried to show in this record how we began the
organisation of our forces overseas. Our first troops to
reach France were associated in small units with the
French. Soon our regiments began to reach the front
under French Division Commanders. Then with the
formation of American divisions, we went into the line
under French corps commanders. Later still, American
corps operated under French Army Commanders.
Finally, our forces augmented by additional divisions
and corps were organised into the First American Field
Army.</p>

<p>Through these various stages of development, our
forces had grown until on August 10th they had reached
the stage where they became practically as independent
an organisation as the British armies under Field Marshal
Sir Douglas Haig and the French armies under
General Petain. From now on the American Army was
to be on a par with the French Army and the British
Army, all three of them under the sole direction of the
Allied Generalissimo, Marshal Ferdinand Foch.</p>

<p>The personnel of this, the greatest single army that
ever fought beneath the Stars and Stripes, is reproduced
in the appendix. It might not be amiss to point out
that an American division numbers thirty thousand men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
and that an American corps consists of six divisions and
auxiliary troops, such as air squadrons, tank sections,
and heavy artillery, which bring the strength of an
American army corps to between 225,000 and 250,000
men. By the 1st of September, the United States of
America had five such army corps in the field, martialling
a strength of about one and one-half million bayonets.
General Pershing was in command of this group
of armies which comprised the First American Field
Army.</p>

<p>It was from these forces that General Pershing selected
the strong units which he personally commanded
in the first major operation of the First American Field
Army as an independent unit in France. That operation
was the beginning of the Pershing push toward the
Rhine&mdash;it was the Battle of St. Mihiel.</p>

<p>It was a great achievement. It signalised the full
development of our forces from small emergency units
that had reached the front less than a year before, to the
now powerful group of armies, fighting under their
own flag, their own generals, and their own staffs.</p>

<p>The important material results of the Battle of St.
Mihiel are most susceptible to civilian as well as military
comprehension. The St. Mihiel salient had long constituted
a pet threat of the enemy. The Germans called
it a dagger pointed at the heart of eastern France. For
three years the enemy occupying it had successfully resisted
all efforts of the Allies to oust them.</p>

<p>The salient was shaped like a triangle. The apex
of the triangle&mdash;the point of the dagger&mdash;thrusting
southward, rested on the town of St. Mihiel, on the river
Meuse. The western flank of the triangle extended
northward from St. Mihiel to points beyond Verdun.
The eastern flank of the triangle extended in a northeasterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
direction toward Pont-à-Mousson. It was the
strongest position held by the Germans in Lorraine&mdash;if
not on the entire front.</p>

<p>The geographical formation of the salient was an invitation
for the application of a pincers operation. The
point of leverage of the opposing jaws of the pincers
was, most naturally, the apex of the triangle at St.
Mihiel.</p>

<p>One claw of the pincers&mdash;a claw some eight miles
thick, bit into the east side of the salient near Pont-à-Mousson
on the west bank of the Moselle River. The
other claw of the pincers was about eight miles thick
and it bit into the western flank of the salient in the
vicinity of the little town of Haudiomont, on the heights
of the Meuse and just a little distance to the east of the
Meuse River.</p>

<p>The distance across that part of the salient through
which the pincer's claws were biting was about thirty
miles, and the area which would be included in the bite
would be almost a hundred and seventy-five square miles.
This, indeed, was a major operation.</p>

<p>The battle began at one o'clock on the morning of
September 12th, when the concentrated ordnance of
the heaviest American artillery in France opened a preparatory
fire of unprecedented intensity.</p>

<p>At five o'clock in the dim dawn of that September
morning, our infantry waves leaped from their trenches
and moved forward to the assault. The claw of the
pincers on the eastern flank of the salient began to bite in.</p>

<p>One hour later the claw of the pincers on the western
flank of the salient began to move forward.</p>

<p>On the east, our men went forward on the run over
ground that we had looked upon with envious eyes from
the day that the first American troops reached the front.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
Before noon we had taken the villages of Lahayville, St.
Baussant, Vilcey and the Bois de Mortmare and we were
still advancing. By nightfall, our lines were still on the
move beyond Essey and we were holding the important
town of Thiaucourt and claimed Villers sur Penny for
our own.</p>

<p>The seemingly impregnable fortress of Mont Sec had
been surrounded, our tanks had cleared the way through
Pannes, we had taken Nonsard and the towns of Woinville
and Buxières had fallen into our hands.</p>

<p>On the west side of the salient the day had gone equally
well for us. The western claw of the pincers had pushed
due east through the towns of Spada and Lavigneville.
Our men had swept on in the night through Chaillon, we
had taken St. Remy and had cleared the Forêt de Montagne.
By midnight their advanced patrols had reached
the western part of the town of Vigneulles. In the
meantime, our forces on the eastern side of the salient
were pushing westward toward this same town of
Vigneulles. At three o'clock in the morning the forces
from the east were occupying the eastern part of the town.
The pincers had closed; the St. Mihiel salient had been
pinched off.</p>

<p>Our forces actually met at nine o'clock on the morning
of September 13th. The junction was made at
the town of Heudicourt to the south of Vigneulles.
We had pocketed all of the German forces to the south
of that town. Our centre had moved forward at nine
o'clock the night before and occupied St. Mihiel on the
heels of the retreating Germans. But the withdrawal
was too late. Large numbers of them found themselves
completely surrounded in the forests between St. Mihiel
on the south and Heudicourt on the north.</p>

<p>We closed in during the afternoon and started to open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
the prize package. Located in the area, encircled by our
troops, was the Bois de Versel, the Bois de Gaumont
and the Bois de Woeuvre. Each one of these little
forests gave up its quota of prisoners, while much material
and rich booty of war fell into our hands.</p>

<p>The principal avenue that had been opened for the
Germans to make a possible withdrawal led through
Vigneulles and before our pincers had completely closed,
the fleeing enemy had poured out through that gap at
the rate of several thousand an hour. The roads were
blocked for miles with their transportation, and when
the American artillery turned its attention to these
thoroughfares, crowded with confused Germans, the
slaughter was terrific. For days after the battle our
sanitation squads were busy at their grewsome work.</p>

<p>In conception and execution the entire operation had
been perfect. Confusion had been visited upon the
method-loving enemy from the beginning. By reason
of the disruption of their intercommunications, faulty
liaison had resulted and division had called to division
in vain for assistance, not knowing at the time that all of
them were in equally desperate straits. The enemy
fought hard but to no purpose.</p>

<p>One entire regiment with its commander and his staff
was captured. With both flanks exposed, it had suddenly
been confronted by Americans on four sides. The
surrender was so complete that the German commander
requested that his roll should be called in order to ascertain
the extent of his losses. When this was done, every
one was accounted for except one officer and one private.</p>

<p>As his command was so embarrassingly complete, the
German commander asked permission to march it off in
whatever direction desired by his captors. The request
was granted, and there followed the somewhat amusing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
spectacle of an entire German regiment, without arms,
marching off the battlefield under their own officers.
The captured regiment was escorted to the rear by
mounted American guards, who smilingly and leisurely
rode their horses cowboy fashion as they herded their
captives back to the pens.</p>

<p>Tons upon tons of ammunition fell into our hands in
the woods. At one place twenty-two railroad cars loaded
with large calibre ammunition had to be abandoned
when an American shell had torn up the track to the
north of them. But if the Germans had been unable to
take with them their equipment, they had succeeded in
driving ahead of them on the retreat almost all of the
French male civilians between sixteen and forty-five
years that had been used as German slaves for more than
four years.</p>

<p>The Americans were welcomed as deliverers by those
French civilians that remained in the town. They were
found to be almost entirely ignorant of the most commonly
known historical events of the war. Secretary
of War Baker and Generals Pershing and Petain visited
the town of St. Mihiel a few hours after it was captured.
They were honoured with a spontaneous demonstration
by the girls and aged women, who crowded about them
to express thanks and pay homage for deliverance.</p>

<p>One of our bands began to play the "Marseillaise" and
the old French civilians who, under German domination,
had not heard the national anthem for four long years,
broke down and wept. The mayor of the town told
how the Germans had robbed it of millions of francs.
First they had demanded and received one million five
hundred thousand francs and later they collected five
hundred thousand more in three instalments. In addition
to these robberies, they had taken by "requisition"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
all the furniture and mattresses and civilian comforts
that they could find. They took what they wanted and
usually destroyed the rest. They had stripped the towns
of all metal utensils, bells, statues, and water pipes.</p>

<p>The St. Mihiel salient thus went out of existence.
The entire point in the blade of the dagger that had been
thrust at the heart of France had been bitten off. Verdun
with its rows upon rows of sacred dead was now
liberated from the threat of envelopment from the right.
The Allies were in possession of the dominating heights
of the Meuse. The railroads connecting Commercy
with Vigneulles, Thiaucourt and St. Mihiel were in our
hands. Our lines had advanced close to that key of
victory, the Briey iron basin to the north, and the German
fortress of Metz lay under American guns.</p>

<p>The battle only lasted twenty-seven hours. In that
space of time, a German force estimated at one hundred
thousand had been vanquished, if not literally cut to
pieces, American soldiers had wrested a hundred and
fifty square miles of territory away from the Germans,
captured fifteen thousand officers and men and hundreds
of guns. General Pershing on September 14th made the
following report:</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p>"The dash and vigour of our troops, and of the valiant
French divisions which fought shoulder to shoulder with
them, is shown by the fact that the forces attacking on
both faces of the salient effected a junction and secured
the result desired within twenty-seven hours.</p>

<p>"Besides liberating more than 150 square miles of territory
and taking 15,000 prisoners, we have captured a
mass of material. Over 100 guns of all calibres and
hundreds of machine guns and trench mortars have been
taken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>"In spite of the fact that the enemy during his retreat
burned large stores, a partial examination of the battlefield
shows that great quantities of ammunition, telegraph
material, railroad material, rolling stock, clothing, and
equipment have been abandoned. Further evidence of the
haste with which the enemy retreated is found in the
uninjured bridges which he left behind.</p>

<p>"French pursuit, bombing and reconnaissance units,
and British and Italian bombing units divided with our
own air service the control of the air, and contributed
materially to the successes of the operation."</p></div>

<p>And while this great battle was in progress, the Allied
lines were advancing everywhere. In Flanders, in
Picardy, on the Marne, in Champagne, in Lorraine, in
Alsace, and in the Balkans the frontier of freedom was
moving forward.</p>

<p>Surely the tide had turned. And surely it had been
America's God-given opportunity to play the big part
she did play. The German was now on the run. Suspicious
whisperings of peace began to be heard in neutral
countries. They had a decided German accent. Germany
saw defeat staring her in the face and now, having
failed to win in the field, she sought to win by a bluff at
the peace table.</p>

<p>The mailed fist having failed, Germany now resorted
to cunning. The mailed fist was now an open palm that
itched to press in brotherhood the hands of the Allies.
But it was the same fist that struck down the peace of the
world in 1914. It was the same Germany that had ravished
and outraged Belgium. It was the same Germany
that had tried to murder France. It was the same Germany
that had covered America with her net of spies and
had sought to bring war to our borders with Mexico and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
Japan. It was the same Germany that had ruthlessly destroyed
the lives of women and children, American citizens,
non-combatants, riding the free seas under the
protection of the Stars and Stripes. It was the same
Germany that had drugged Russia with her corrupting
propaganda and had throttled the voice of Russian democracy.
This Germany, this unrepentant Germany&mdash;this
unpunished Germany, launched her drive for peace.</p>

<p>Germany was willing to make any concessions to bring
about negotiations that would save her from a defeat in
the field. There was one thing, however, that Germany
wanted to save from the ruin she had brought down upon
herself. That thing was the German army and its strong
auxiliary, the German navy. Neither one of them had
been destroyed. The army was in general retreat and
the navy was locked up in the Baltic, but both of them
remained in existence as menaces to the future peace of
the world. With these two forces of might, Germany
could have given up her booty of war, offered reparation
for her transgressions and drawn back behind the Rhine
to await the coming of another <i>Der Tag</i> when she
could send them once more crashing across friendly
borders and cruising the seven seas on missions of piracy.</p>

<p>Germany was in the position of a bully, who without
provocation and without warning had struck down from
behind a man who had not been prepared to defend himself.
The victim's movements had been impeded by a
heavy overcoat. He had been utterly and entirely unprepared
for the onslaught. The bully had struck him
with a club and had robbed him.</p>

<p>The unprepared man had tried to free himself from the
overcoat of pacifism that he had worn so long in safety
and in kindliness to his fellows. The bully, taking advantage
of his handicap, had beaten him brutally. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
last the unprepared man had freed himself from the
overcoat and then stood ready not only to defend himself,
but to administer deserved punishment. Then the
bully had said:</p>

<p>"Now, wait just a minute. Let's talk this thing over
and see if we can't settle it before I get hurt."</p>

<p>The bully's pockets bulge with the loot he has taken
from the man. The victim's face and head are swollen
and bloody and yet the bully invites him to sit down to a
table to discuss the hold-up, the assault, and the terms of
which the loot and the loot only will be returned. The
bully takes it for granted that he is to go unpunished and,
more important still, is to retain the club that he might
decide to use again.</p>

<p>The rule of common sense that deals with individuals
should be the same rule that applies to the affairs of nations.
No municipal law anywhere in the world gives
countenance to a compromise with a criminal. International
law could be no less moral than municipal law.
Prussian militarism made the world unsafe for Democracy,
and for that reason, on April 6th, 1917, the United
States entered the war.</p>

<p>We wanted a decent world in which to live. And the
existence of the Prussian army and its conscienceless
masters was incompatible with the free and peaceful life
of the world. We entered the war for an ideal. That
ideal was in the balance when Germany made her 1918
drive for peace.</p>

<p>Our army in France knew that if peace came with an
unwhipped Prussian army in existence, the world would
be just as unsafe for Democracy as it had ever been.
Our army in France wanted no compromise that would
leave Germany in possession of the instruments that had
made possible her crimes against the world. Every man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
that had shed blood, every man that had paid the final
price, every woman that had shed tears, every cherished
ideal of our one hundred and forty years of national life,
would have been sacrificed in vain, if we had condoned
Germany's high crimes against civilisation and had made
a compromise with the criminal.</p>

<p>Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States,
spokesman of the Allied world, sounded the true American
note when, in his reply to the insincere German peace
proposals, he referred the German Government to Marshal
Foch, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied armies.
War by the sword was to bring peace by the sword.</p>

<p>And as I write these lines in the last days of October,
1918, unconditional surrender is the song of the dove
of peace perched on our bayonets as we march into the
dawn of victory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>
